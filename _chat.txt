[05/05/23, 4:41:37 PM] ThiyagaB: Just as a start, anyone can try guessing why this name 
Cornucopia :)?
[05/05/23, 4:58:24 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Large amount of people coming together to achieve something great/successful
[05/05/23, 5:05:23 PM] ThiyagaB: Good try, 
But wrong 😉

[05/05/23, 5:11:35 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: So we guys demand only the best and you will keep encouraging us by giving us some tips as stimulation?!
[05/05/23, 5:28:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Iyo i never meant this cornucopia kids, this doesn’t sound good :) 

If you have seen the movie hunger games, you might have some idea
[05/05/23, 5:35:33 PM] ~ Arun: Talanted people survive/grab opportunities
[05/05/23, 5:48:03 PM] Product Manager: Hi guys, this is Sheshayani
[05/05/23, 5:54:25 PM] Product Manager: If any of you guys know Greek Mythology, you must be familiar with Zeus. 

Baby Zeus was taken care of by Amalthea, a goat.

While playing with her he accidentally broke her horn, and as a compensation he'll bless the broken horn with abundant nourishment for her(never ending). So whenever she's hungry she'll get edibles from the broken horn, which is called the Cornucopia.

[05/05/23, 5:56:40 PM] Product Manager: In hunger games Cornucopia was the area where all the resources needed by the tributes to survive will be present
[05/05/23, 5:57:29 PM] ~ Karan: Athu ok
[05/05/23, 5:57:35 PM] ~ Karan: Yy fruits?
[05/05/23, 5:57:57 PM] Product Manager: The idea behind the name is to provide a space for abundance knowledge which nourishes us
[05/05/23, 5:58:12 PM] ThiyagaB: Good question, sollunga sheshayani :) 

She is the one who coined the name for the group
[05/05/23, 5:58:53 PM] Product Manager: 😂
[05/05/23, 6:03:00 PM] Product Manager: Like mentioned here Cornucopia represents nourishment aka harvest too(this is how people usually start rituals right, that basket represents goat's horn, it's a famous thanksgiving tradition)
[05/05/23, 6:03:22 PM] Product Manager: As for here, we didn't have time to pick a better dp😂

[13/05/23, 12:41:39 PM] ThiyagaB: I thought of asking  aptitude questions often in this group, and see who answers first, ( if it goes useful and good, we will think of some rewards :) )
[13/05/23, 12:42:37 PM] ThiyagaB: A train 100 m long crosses a bridge 200 m long and 20 m wide in 25 seconds. What is the speed of the train in km/hr?

I trust you wont use google to solve :)

[13/05/23, 12:48:35 PM] ThiyagaB: Wrong :)

[13/05/23, 12:50:18 PM] ~ Karan: Should the full train need to cross the bridge
[13/05/23, 12:53:21 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes
[13/05/23, 12:53:47 PM] ThiyagaB: You asked the right question, that’s the point
[13/05/23, 12:58:50 PM] ~ Arun: 12
[13/05/23, 12:59:45 PM] ~ karthick: Sir. I guess its approximately 43 km/hr
[13/05/23, 1:00:04 PM] ThiyagaB: Perfect, can you give the exact number
[13/05/23, 1:00:05 PM] ~ Karan: Ans:43.2276657 km/hr
[13/05/23, 1:00:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Super… 👏👏
[13/05/23, 1:00:43 PM] ~ karthick: .3/.00694
[13/05/23, 1:01:01 PM] ~ karthick: This is the calculation. Right ?
[13/05/23, 1:02:50 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Sir I found  12 m/s instead of  finding km/hr😂 by using the speed formula
[13/05/23, 1:03:01 PM] ThiyagaB: The speed of the train is 
length of train+length of bridge/time
300/25 = 12

now to convert m/s to km/h, the formula is to multiply it by 18/5. ( This is the key to remember, and from km/h to m/s its, 5/18)
12*18/5 = 43.2..km/h
[13/05/23, 1:03:50 PM] ThiyagaB: yess.. :)  its basic.. we will see more questions..

A man can row 10 km upstream in 60 minutes and 20 km downstream in 40 minutes. What is the man's speed in still water and the speed of the current?
[14/05/23, 1:45:30 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Speed in still water is 4km/hr
[14/05/23, 1:46:10 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Speed of current I'm getting in minus
-2
[14/05/23, 1:47:06 PM] ThiyagaB: :) 
Check again, even in upstream he can row at a speed of 10km, then still water la it should be more la
[14/05/23, 1:47:21 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Ohkay sir I'll try again
[14/05/23, 1:55:16 PM] ~ Madhubaalika: Speed in still water=20 km/hr
Speed of current =10km/hr
[14/05/23, 1:56:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Wonderful 👏👏
Can you also explain
[14/05/23, 1:58:49 PM] ~ Madhubaalika: Distance /speed=time formula sir
[14/05/23, 1:59:20 PM] ThiyagaB: Very nice 👌

[18/05/23, 8:08:23 PM] ThiyagaB: Resuming our aptitude questions,

 Its quite simple, lets see who gets it.

If the radius of a circle is diminished by 10%, then its area is diminished by:
[18/05/23, 8:11:45 PM] ~ karthick: Area will be reduced by 19 %
[18/05/23, 8:12:25 PM] ThiyagaB: Niceee. correct answer..   Guys, can you enable whatsapp payment here..  i will reward one small amount as prize :) 

10 to 100 based on complexity of question.
[18/05/23, 8:19:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Good one
[18/05/23, 8:20:53 PM] ThiyagaB: All, 
its small amount, it doesnt matter, but just a small motivation to keep trying..  and i ll ask few complex questions where we will bet more money :)
[18/05/23, 8:22:53 PM] ~ karthick: Thank you so much sir .
[20/05/23, 4:48:00 PM] ThiyagaB: Today's quiz


Our Karthik travels to office daily,  
He is a sensible driver and he drives at  30km/h from his home and  reaches his office 30 mins late, the next day when he drives 40km/h he reaches 30mins earlier, 
Now tell me what is the distance to his office from home?
[20/05/23, 4:50:40 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: the distance from Karthik's home to his office is 60 kilometers.
[20/05/23, 4:51:22 PM] ThiyagaB: wrong :)
[20/05/23, 4:52:34 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: Okey sir.. I'll try again
[20/05/23, 4:52:35 PM] ~ 👑: 120km
[20/05/23, 4:52:48 PM] ThiyagaB: again, right answer deserves 10₹
[20/05/23, 4:52:56 PM] ThiyagaB: wonderful.. explanation plz
[20/05/23, 4:56:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Hope you got it
[20/05/23, 4:59:27 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: ‎This message was deleted.
[20/05/23, 5:00:21 PM] ~ 👑: If he drives at 30km/hr....he reaches his office 30mins late ....then

Time =dist/speed

X+30=dist/30


If he drives 40km/hr...he reaches 30mins earlier...

So ...

X-30=dist/40



Therefore....

If we subtract these  2 equations

d=120km
[20/05/23, 5:00:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Good 👍🏼 and you got the 10₹
[20/05/23, 5:01:06 PM] ~ 👑: ✨TQ sir😇 ✨
[20/05/23, 5:36:02 PM] ThiyagaB: ‎POLL:
Folks i was assuming most of you are second or third year,
Could you please help vote the poll,
( also this vote will help understand how many of you are active in this group :) )
‎OPTION: Final year (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Third year (4 votes)
‎OPTION: Second year (13 votes)
‎OPTION: First year (24 votes)
‎OPTION: School (0 votes)
[21/05/23, 12:34:29 PM] ThiyagaB: Good morning folks, there are 52 ppl in group and only got 32 votes, inactive ppl will be removed eventually
[21/05/23, 1:13:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Time for next quiz, 
Hint to answer:
This is more than just a aptitude question, also feel free to clarify if you don’t understand

There is an app called CRED ( you might have seen in our IPL matches )
CRED gives 9% interest to your money ( like fixed deposit) 
CRED also gives personal loan with 15% interest. 

Now what is the profit margin for CRED
[21/05/23, 1:13:41 PM] ThiyagaB: Right answer with proper explanation gets 50₹
[21/05/23, 1:18:26 PM] ThiyagaB: :) no
[21/05/23, 1:18:30 PM] ThiyagaB: Good try though
[21/05/23, 2:00:12 PM] ~ 👑: 4.2%
[21/05/23, 2:08:30 PM] ThiyagaB: Wrong again
[21/05/23, 2:08:40 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok i will explain more with example, let’s see
[21/05/23, 2:09:13 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: 6%
[21/05/23, 2:09:20 PM] ThiyagaB: Nope
[21/05/23, 2:09:34 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Ok sir
[21/05/23, 2:09:50 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: 4%
[21/05/23, 2:10:40 PM] ThiyagaB: I am CRED,
Madhu gives me 1 lakh, and i am going to give her 9% interest per year

Pooja gets 1 lakh from me, and i get 15% interest from her every year

So what’s the profit margin for me
[21/05/23, 2:58:43 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: 5.2%
[21/05/23, 3:02:02 PM] ~ 👑: 6%

[21/05/23, 3:02:57 PM] ThiyagaB: :) wrong again
[21/05/23, 3:03:25 PM] ~ 👑: 60%
[21/05/23, 3:03:27 PM] Ganesh SG INDIA: Clue is... 1 lakh is not the denominator
[21/05/23, 3:05:42 PM] ~ Arun: 16.6%
[21/05/23, 3:06:48 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: ‎This message was deleted.
[21/05/23, 3:06:50 PM] ThiyagaB: It’s getting interesting :)  
I told you all it’s more than just aptitude

Ask yourself what is profit?
[21/05/23, 3:07:22 PM] ThiyagaB: Now i am interested, enga irundhu indha 41.09 vandhuchu
[21/05/23, 3:07:34 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha delete pannita

[21/05/23, 3:08:06 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok tell me what’s profit?
[21/05/23, 3:09:41 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: 5.50%
[21/05/23, 3:09:58 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Selling price  - Cost price
[21/05/23, 3:10:48 PM] ThiyagaB: Good as i always say, business first then tech..
So think you are CRED and doing this business, what’s the profit you are getting
[21/05/23, 3:11:17 PM] ~ 👑: 6000
[21/05/23, 3:11:23 PM] ~ 👑: Profit
[21/05/23, 3:11:34 PM] ~ Karan: 0.06℅
[21/05/23, 3:12:13 PM] ~ Sowmiya Saravanan: Profit is Rs.72000
[21/05/23, 3:12:22 PM] ThiyagaB: :) again wrong
[21/05/23, 3:12:34 PM] ThiyagaB: This is the basis of all banks, the way bank works
[21/05/23, 3:12:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Gets money from ppl as deposits and savings account
And distribute as loans
[21/05/23, 3:15:24 PM] ~ Sowmiya Saravanan: Profit margin is 40%
[21/05/23, 3:15:27 PM] ThiyagaB: I will reveal the answer by 4, let’s see
[21/05/23, 3:15:38 PM] ThiyagaB: Nope

[21/05/23, 3:18:37 PM] ThiyagaB: The question is profit %, 
we also didn’t ask what’s the profit in one year
[21/05/23, 3:19:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Very good try 👏 but sorry
[21/05/23, 3:20:24 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: 5%
[21/05/23, 3:21:26 PM] ThiyagaB: It’s still maths, but again think from a business perspective and stick to basics

How a profit is made
[21/05/23, 3:22:15 PM] ~ karthick: So if we are CRED we should also think about other factors that affect or increase the profit? Right, or the answer lies only with these two transactions?
[21/05/23, 3:22:44 PM] ~ Sowmiya Saravanan: 36%
[21/05/23, 3:23:28 PM] ~ 👑: 30%
[21/05/23, 3:23:30 PM] ThiyagaB: That’s great you are right, but for this calculation to make it simple let’s assume and don’t take other factors like his marketing costs, development costs etc
[21/05/23, 3:23:51 PM] ThiyagaB: Just do with this numbers alone
[21/05/23, 3:23:54 PM] ~ karthick: Ok sir.

[21/05/23, 3:36:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Check question again, we didn’t ask profit per year, 
It’s profit  margin %
[21/05/23, 3:36:26 PM] ~ 👑: Ok sir
[21/05/23, 3:37:10 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: (115-109)/109 *100
[21/05/23, 3:38:18 PM] ThiyagaB: Formula is right in general,

[21/05/23, 3:58:41 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok giving final hints,

You calculate profit by 
Your investment vs return or
( sell price - cost price) 

Just find what’s investment from CRED here, and calculate profit percentage
[21/05/23, 4:01:33 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: 26.3%
[21/05/23, 4:03:18 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: -0.88% there might actually be a loss?
[21/05/23, 4:03:24 PM] ThiyagaB: In this question, someone tell me what’s the investment from CRED?
[21/05/23, 4:03:43 PM] ~ Karan: Zero
[21/05/23, 4:03:43 PM] ~ Karthi: 0
[21/05/23, 4:04:03 PM] ThiyagaB: Good, so now find the answer :)
[21/05/23, 4:05:46 PM] ~ Karthi: 3%
[21/05/23, 4:06:30 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok 5 more mins, will tell the answer
[21/05/23, 4:06:30 PM] ~ Keerthana✨✌🏻: 0%
[21/05/23, 4:06:49 PM] ThiyagaB: 0% profit ku en business panran avan :)
[21/05/23, 4:07:11 PM] ~ 👑: 0.3%
[21/05/23, 4:07:41 PM] ThiyagaB: Sari investment is 0, 
So now put this in your profit formula
[21/05/23, 4:11:56 PM] ThiyagaB: More than maths, use simple logical thinking

CRED is here making profit without making any investment ( ignoring other factors like marketing etc) ,
He earns money by simply getting from one side and giving to others

So with this, the profit % is infinite

As your denominator is 0 :)
[21/05/23, 4:12:13 PM] ThiyagaB: That’s how banks, these companies makes profits
[21/05/23, 4:12:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Hope this question gives different perception for thinking 

Enjoy the weekend

[28/05/23, 8:30:19 PM] ThiyagaB: Today’s quiz 

There are three people (Alex, Ben and Cody), one of whom is a knight, one a knave, and one a spy. The knight always tells the truth, the knave always lies, and the spy can either lie or tell the truth. Alex says: "Cody is a knave.” Ben says: "Alex is a knight.” Cody says: "I am the spy.” Who is the knight, who the knave, and who the spy?
[28/05/23, 8:30:33 PM] ThiyagaB: 20₹ again :)
[28/05/23, 8:33:42 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Alex is a knave
Ben is a knight
[28/05/23, 8:33:46 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Cody is a spy
[28/05/23, 8:34:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Explanation
[28/05/23, 8:34:27 PM] ~ swetha: Alex is the knight
Cody is the knave
Ben is the spy
[28/05/23, 8:35:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Should have right explanation
[28/05/23, 8:35:21 PM] ~ Karan: Alex- knight
Cody-knave
Ben-spy
[28/05/23, 8:35:44 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Alex knight
Cody knave
Ben spy
[28/05/23, 8:36:03 PM] ~ swetha: Since Alex is the knight, he's saying the truth that Cody is the knave and since Cody is the knave he's probably lying that he's the spy and since the spy can either lie or say the truth, he's saying the truth that Alex is the knight
[28/05/23, 8:36:23 PM] ~ Karan: Spy won't tell  "i am a spy"
[28/05/23, 8:37:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha nice
[28/05/23, 8:37:19 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: If Alex is knight - Alex tells truth, then Cody is knave.

Since Cody is knave, he tell lie so he is not spy.

Since Ben is spy , he tells truth
[28/05/23, 8:38:34 PM] ThiyagaB: Perfect, @917338976596 gets it first, so gets 20₹

Thanks @917871024774 for helping with questions
[28/05/23, 8:47:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw anyone who is interested in coding, i have a small project, reply here or message me if you can give a try. 
If you can complete the project will be paid. ( only if it is completed )
[28/05/23, 8:47:42 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: What coding sir?
[28/05/23, 8:52:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok many of you messaged me, i will share the problem statement here, let’s see who helps find best solution. 


Every time i do a poll in WhatsApp,  i want to export this to an excel and get a stats about this group. 

Problem statement:
I want to find a way to export the poll results with names to excel

Additional points: 
You can’t do this in mobile, but you can try to build a chrome extension which reads from web.whatsapp.com ( there is already one extension to export polls but it’s not working )
[28/05/23, 8:54:16 PM] ThiyagaB: The first step to solve a problem is understand with good clarity, so ask your questions here. 
Then explore existing options, then do a design. 
A chrome extension is easy and can be built with lots of tutorials available online.
[28/05/23, 9:00:03 PM] ~ ^_^: Sir is it like copying the poll path and linking it to the mysql database connected to excel so that the details get saved ?
[28/05/23, 9:05:37 PM] ThiyagaB: i like the way you are thinking.. but avlo la illa..  

there are multiple ways to do, even i dont know what is the best way..  all i need is this poll details from this group to be shown in excel.  u figure out.

As of now, one solution i thought about is, open this chat in laptop chrome browser, build a chrome extension ( hope you all know what a chrome extension is), and extract this poll data from the html. 


Hint:  You can also use chatgpt or bard.google.com, to find answers..  unlike the quiz, this one is all about exploring, and design thinking.
[28/05/23, 9:06:41 PM] ~ ^_^: Okay Sir

[03/06/23, 5:28:00 PM] ThiyagaB: All,

I have ONE free slot available in second half of this month for in person session, any college like to host, message me in person
[03/06/23, 7:11:02 PM] ThiyagaB: A simple quiz today, 

During a heavy rain day, if you see a lightning followed by thunder in 4 secs, 
What is the approx distance of lightning from your place?
10₹ bet
[03/06/23, 7:11:28 PM] ~ Naren: 1320m
[03/06/23, 7:12:07 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: 1360m
[03/06/23, 7:12:08 PM] ~ 👑: I think 1366m 🤔
[03/06/23, 7:12:13 PM] ThiyagaB: How?
[03/06/23, 7:12:17 PM] ThiyagaB: Explanation
[03/06/23, 7:12:56 PM] ~ 👑: Sry 1360 is right
[03/06/23, 7:12:58 PM] ~ 👑: Ok
[03/06/23, 7:13:07 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: Speed of sound x sec
[03/06/23, 7:13:31 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: 340*4
[03/06/23, 7:13:32 PM] ~ 👑: d=vt 
So 
d=340×4
d=1360m
[03/06/23, 7:14:22 PM] ThiyagaB: Cool both are right 👍🏼. 
I guess it’s very easy isn’t it :)
[03/06/23, 7:14:47 PM] ~ 👑: ‎This message was deleted.
[03/06/23, 7:14:57 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: Yes sir
[03/06/23, 7:15:50 PM] ThiyagaB: Hope both of you got 10₹
[03/06/23, 7:16:06 PM] ~ 👑: Yes sir thank you👍😇
[03/06/23, 7:16:26 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: Thank you sir 👍
[03/06/23, 7:17:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw last week few ppl showed interest in coding this, but apram aalaye kaanum 😉
Need any directions?
[03/06/23, 7:19:15 PM] ~ SIVASARAN: Yes sir give any Idea we will try
[03/06/23, 7:20:37 PM] ThiyagaB: There is no direct ways to do it
So hope you all know
1. Using web.whatsapp.com to open whatsapp in browser
2. Find how to do “web scraping” this is one cool ways you get info from online
[03/06/23, 7:21:04 PM] ~ 👑: Ok sir
[03/06/23, 7:22:10 PM] ThiyagaB: This is just to get start with this, as i said use chatgpt or bard
[03/06/23, 7:28:12 PM] ThiyagaB: Can you explain better for other ppl here, few ppl pinged and asked how it works.

Why we took only sound velocity why not light velocity
[03/06/23, 7:34:27 PM] ~ ^_^: Is it becoz we hear the sound first and then see the lightning?
[03/06/23, 7:40:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Not to me, to others explain the logic :)

I co-created this page with one of my student here @917871024774 
It’s completely her idea, i guided to bring it alive and also for the love of our language tamil. 

Now the task is simple, 

checkout the page, 
create a template ( or a sample post) that fits to the theme of this page
Share the pic to me here or in private message

Who gets it better, we can talk further :) 
You will get 50₹ for trying even if it’s not selected 
Good luck.

[05/06/23, 5:47:43 PM] ThiyagaB: Today’s quiz 
If i have a paper of thickness 1mm ( assume its length and width is large enough to fold multiple times) 
How many times i should fold the paper so it would reach the moon. 

The question has two answers, let’s c
20₹
[05/06/23, 5:49:51 PM] ~ 👑: 40times
[05/06/23, 5:49:56 PM] ~ 👑: 42 times
[05/06/23, 5:50:24 PM] ~ karthick: 3,84,40,00,00,000 times
[05/06/23, 5:50:37 PM] ThiyagaB: Nope
[05/06/23, 5:50:44 PM] ThiyagaB: Answer with explanation please
[05/06/23, 5:51:15 PM] ~ karthick: Distance from earth to moon is  384400 kms
[05/06/23, 5:51:33 PM] ~ karthick: I converted it to mm 😌
[05/06/23, 5:52:41 PM] ~ karthick: I think its one time less
[05/06/23, 5:53:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Check the question you are folding, not placing one top of the other
[05/06/23, 5:53:24 PM] ~ Sowmiya Saravanan: 45times
[05/06/23, 5:53:50 PM] ~ 👑: 42 is right or wrong sir
[05/06/23, 5:57:31 PM] ~ karthick: 3,84,39,99,99,999. Because the first fold will create 2mm height so no. of folds will be  one less than the actual height between earth and moon.
[05/06/23, 5:58:18 PM] ~ 👑: 68719476736times
[05/06/23, 5:58:18 PM] ~ Karan: Zero
[05/06/23, 5:59:02 PM] ThiyagaB: Nee ultimate da :) 
I really want to know the explanation
[05/06/23, 5:59:21 PM] ThiyagaB: You still didn’t tell me, how
[05/06/23, 6:00:02 PM] ThiyagaB: Tell me what happens in the second fold,?
[05/06/23, 6:00:19 PM] ~ Karan: If the length is large enough then why we need to fold it. 😌
[05/06/23, 6:00:39 PM] ThiyagaB: Apdiye thiruppi nikka vechiduvom?? :)
[05/06/23, 6:01:08 PM] ~ karthick: By folding you mean folding it into two halves then the two halves into four ?
[05/06/23, 6:01:32 PM] ~ 👑: If we fold   42times  ....then 2^42=4.3980....
[05/06/23, 6:01:36 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes just how you fold a paper,
[05/06/23, 6:01:50 PM] ~ 👑: It's approximate to  moons distance
[05/06/23, 6:01:56 PM] ThiyagaB: This is more than the distance to moon isn’t it?
[05/06/23, 6:03:08 PM] ~ karthick: ‎This message was deleted.
[05/06/23, 6:03:26 PM] ThiyagaB: But @917826063097 good thought
[05/06/23, 6:06:09 PM] ~ Karan: 🙂
[05/06/23, 6:06:59 PM] ~ 👑: 35 times sir
[05/06/23, 6:07:05 PM] ~ karthick: 38 folds approx .
[05/06/23, 6:07:45 PM] ~ Karan: The width is also large. So we can do hollow cylinder which connect moon and earth. It require only one fold.
[05/06/23, 6:08:17 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok i will give it to this, 
It’s 38 to 39 folds

When i found the answer, it was surprising just less than 40 times la
[05/06/23, 6:08:47 PM] ThiyagaB: Superr nee Vera level, idhukagave Unaku 5₹ extra
[05/06/23, 6:09:14 PM] ThiyagaB: I will give karthik and karan, 
@919363469997 you almost got it
[05/06/23, 6:10:11 PM] ThiyagaB:
[05/06/23, 6:10:21 PM] ThiyagaB: Karan hope you got it too
[05/06/23, 6:12:12 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw the actual answer to the question is, 

You can’t fold the paper more than 7 times, any size of paper it’s impossible to do it. 
I guess they tried and their is a world record for folding the paper 10 or 11 times max.. can’t do more than that
[05/06/23, 6:12:55 PM] ThiyagaB: mathematically the answers given by you are correct,
But practically it’s not possible to fold the paper that many times
[05/06/23, 6:13:08 PM] ~ 👑: Ok sir
[05/06/23, 6:30:57 PM] ~ Karan: Got it sir.

[09/06/23, 8:20:23 PM] ThiyagaB: Yet another question with clock,

You have a digital clock that displays time in the 24-hour format (00:00 to 23:59). How many times a day do all the digits on the clock appear in strictly increasing order (e.g., 01:23, 01:57,03:47)?

[09/06/23, 9:10:47 PM] Vinith Walmart: No
[09/06/23, 9:10:56 PM] ThiyagaB: 00:01 is not right sequence
All 4 digits should be increasing order

i thought of waiting more like yesterday, 

Your balance kept increasing dude… brilliant work 👍🏼👍🏼
[10/06/23, 9:05:59 PM] Koushik PEC: ‎This message was deleted.
[10/06/23, 9:07:13 PM] ~ karthick: Sir. In this question we are going to place only queens and no other pieces. Right ?
[10/06/23, 9:14:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes
[10/06/23, 9:26:52 PM] ~ karthick: Ok sir.
[10/06/23, 9:34:11 PM] ~ Karan: N-2 queens
[10/06/23, 9:34:32 PM] Koushik PEC: What if n is 5
[10/06/23, 9:34:49 PM] Koushik PEC: Still we could place 5 queens
[10/06/23, 9:40:38 PM] ~ Karan: If( n=even) 
n-2 queen can be placed
elif(n=odd) 
n queen can be placed
else
Zero
[10/06/23, 9:41:13 PM] Koushik PEC: 4 is even still could place 4 queens
[10/06/23, 9:54:02 PM] ~ Karan: then 
n, n-1
[10/06/23, 9:55:23 PM] Koushik PEC: .
[11/06/23, 12:24:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Good morning ppl,
If you are all mobile addict like me, 
I use an app called sololearn to learn most of programming languages for free from mobile, 
The app is super cool and has small exercises for many programming languages,

Checkout the site, and try the app
https://www.sololearn.com/
[11/06/23, 12:29:52 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok not enough interest, so we will skip the open discussion. 

It’s pretty usual for any group to be read only, but not to express or open to discuss 

Even here i could see only 5-6 of you attempt the quizzes regularly, others just watch :) 

My first target is to get most of you to participate
[12/06/23, 6:08:04 PM] ThiyagaB: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ml4abykVBGs 

How many of us need this? 

NVIDIA Eye contact, so you always look attentive in the online meetings :)
[12/06/23, 8:00:38 PM] Koushik PEC: ‎This message was deleted.
[12/06/23, 8:00:40 PM] ThiyagaB: Now the question is, 
How much height the ocean water level will be increased, if we put the entire 8 billion humans in ocean , 
(Seems sadistic, but only look at it from maths angle )
[12/06/23, 8:01:01 PM] ThiyagaB: @919500144487 i know you are quick, innum question e ketkla
[12/06/23, 8:02:05 PM] ThiyagaB: This don’t have a precise answer, 
The answer is all about your approach to this problem, so you can assume any logical numbers for each human weight, ocean area etc..
[12/06/23, 8:02:35 PM] ThiyagaB: So reply with your approach, not exact answer
[12/06/23, 8:02:42 PM] Koushik PEC: due to buoyancy all the bodies will float
[12/06/23, 8:02:52 PM] Koushik PEC: so no increse in water levels
[12/06/23, 8:03:45 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha good one, i removed the word “dump the humans” as it sounded very sadistic.. 
but assume all of us drowned
[12/06/23, 8:04:00 PM] Koushik PEC: ok sir
[12/06/23, 8:06:19 PM] ~ 👑: Person's weight *8
[12/06/23, 8:06:20 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: The ocean level will increase equal to the amount of weight we put in
[12/06/23, 8:07:01 PM] ~ 👑: Each Person's weight x 8
[12/06/23, 8:07:04 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: So if we put in 8billion humans then that much level of ocean water would maybe increase
[12/06/23, 8:07:14 PM] Koushik PEC: i think rather than the weight it will be equal to the volume
[12/06/23, 8:08:37 PM] ThiyagaB: You just rephrased my question into answer, 

You need to assume an average human weight,
And get ocean water area or volume ( from Google) 
And give me the approach and number
[12/06/23, 8:11:06 PM] Koushik PEC: 40 billion cubic feet (if we assume a person is 5feet tall)
[12/06/23, 8:11:49 PM] Koushik PEC: may be a larger number it is much less in case of an ocean
[12/06/23, 8:16:40 PM] ThiyagaB: Okay… how much height the water level be increased?
[12/06/23, 8:17:04 PM] Koushik PEC: very minimal sir
[12/06/23, 8:17:05 PM] ~ ^_^: Assuming each person's weight as 1 kg🥲...so 8 billion kgs multiplied by area of water in oceans which is 139 million..it comes 1.112 trillion etc etc..🥲
[12/06/23, 8:17:30 PM] ThiyagaB: Oru 5 cm?
[12/06/23, 8:17:35 PM] ~ ^_^: Till the height of Marina's lighthouse Sir
[12/06/23, 8:17:39 PM] ThiyagaB: Give me approx
[12/06/23, 8:17:50 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha yammaaaaadi
[12/06/23, 8:18:00 PM] Koushik PEC: less than 0.5cm
[12/06/23, 8:18:01 PM] Koushik PEC: sir
[12/06/23, 8:18:03 PM] ThiyagaB: You over estimate Humans
[12/06/23, 8:18:36 PM] ThiyagaB: How
[12/06/23, 8:19:04 PM] Koushik PEC: the surface area of ocean is 139 sq miles sir
[12/06/23, 8:19:20 PM] ~ ^_^: Height would not increase sir
[12/06/23, 8:19:33 PM] Koushik PEC: 40 billion cubic feet  is much less sir
[12/06/23, 8:20:30 PM] ~ ^_^: Earth round bro...water coming on the land...Earth become Neptune
[12/06/23, 8:20:42 PM] ~ ^_^: So no increase in height 🥲
[12/06/23, 8:21:05 PM] Koushik PEC: that is like braking physics bro
[12/06/23, 8:21:10 PM] Koushik PEC: can't be
[12/06/23, 8:22:29 PM] ~ ^_^: Sir breaking the matrix..we can't break physics?🥲
[12/06/23, 8:23:27 PM] ~ ^_^: But practically how will the water increase..our body is made up of 70% water..even if water increases..it would be minimal
[12/06/23, 8:29:22 PM] Koushik PEC: it is based on the volume bro
[12/06/23, 8:29:42 PM] Koushik PEC: imagine a bowl of water as ocean
[12/06/23, 8:30:22 PM] Koushik PEC: though u add any water compound to it increases
[12/06/23, 8:49:29 PM] ~ karthick: I think the  answer will be in order of nano meter.
[12/06/23, 9:24:35 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes @918778594857  and @919500144487  gets it.   the exact answer doesnt matter.. its in the order of micrometer.. 
Basically even if we dump all of the humans in the world in ocean, it doesnt feel a thing :) 

though its a physics question,  its a bit philosophical too..  
we are NOTHING in this world,  feel it, feel light, and dont get heavy with unnecessary emotions :)
[12/06/23, 9:30:36 PM] ThiyagaB:
[14/06/23, 8:31:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Today’s quiz

The length of shadow of a pole on ground is 15 m and the inclination of sun with horizontal is 40 degrees. Find the height of the pole.
[14/06/23, 8:31:38 PM] ThiyagaB: I will give the answer in one hour to allow everyone to try
[14/06/23, 8:34:58 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: tan(angle) = height of pole / length of shadow

tan(40°) = h / 15


h = tan(40°) * 15

 tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391

h = 0.8391 * 15

h ≈ 12.59 m

Therefore, the height of the pole is approximately 12.59 meters.
[14/06/23, 8:36:50 PM] ~ Karan: 12.5864945m
[14/06/23, 8:38:53 PM] Koushik PEC: 12.59m
[14/06/23, 9:11:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Only 4 answered
[14/06/23, 9:16:29 PM] ~ ^_^: Same same Sir 12.59
[14/06/23, 9:22:55 PM] ~ 👑: Same 12.59 sir
[14/06/23, 9:24:42 PM] ~ Arun: Same 12.59m sir
[14/06/23, 9:36:49 PM] ThiyagaB: Oh same, so didn’t answer :)
[14/06/23, 9:36:59 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok pooja gets this
[14/06/23, 9:37:23 PM] ThiyagaB:
[14/06/23, 9:38:40 PM] ~ Pooja 💙✨: Thankyou Sir  😊

Why Apple is Apple, when it comes to branding
[16/06/23, 9:11:45 PM] ThiyagaB: Today’s quiz: 

A bit open ended, 
You have 1kg of hydrogen, hypothetically if we can completely use this hydrogen as energy, 
What can we achieve with this fuel?
[16/06/23, 9:13:32 PM] Koushik PEC: Basic heat and light energy can be achieved through combustion
[16/06/23, 9:14:07 PM] ~ ^_^: Electricity can be achieved Sir
[16/06/23, 9:14:51 PM] ThiyagaB: Hypothetical all of the energy, how much energy you ll get, what you can do with it?

If electricity, how much
[16/06/23, 9:14:56 PM] ThiyagaB: Approx value
[16/06/23, 9:16:52 PM] ~ ^_^: 33kwh
[16/06/23, 9:17:44 PM] Koushik PEC: 120 mega joules
[16/06/23, 9:17:53 PM] ThiyagaB: I will wait for answers from all… 
It’s an interesting question, don’t think conventionally…
[16/06/23, 9:18:53 PM] ~ ^_^: Okay Sir
[16/06/23, 9:28:16 PM] Koushik PEC: If we could burn it we could produce heat through which electricity can be produced and through the reaction we could produce 8 to 9 ltrs of pure water
[16/06/23, 9:29:01 PM] ~ ✨: Hydrogen is a clean fuel.. So hydrogen produce water..
[16/06/23, 9:30:41 PM] ThiyagaB: The clue is don’t think your conventional way of energy, 
Its more of a physics question, and all of you are familiar with this famous theory
[16/06/23, 9:32:11 PM] ~ 👑: Used as a fuel for vehicles
[16/06/23, 9:33:13 PM] ~ 👑: 1kg of hydrogen= 2.8kg of gasoline
[16/06/23, 9:33:56 PM] ThiyagaB: :) ok you are all still thinking conventional way.. 
one other clue, 
Einstein equation
[16/06/23, 9:34:30 PM] ~ 👑: Bohr's theory
[16/06/23, 9:34:33 PM] ~ 👑: ?
[16/06/23, 9:34:47 PM] Koushik PEC: E=mc2
[16/06/23, 9:35:05 PM] ~ Arun: E=mc2
[16/06/23, 9:35:17 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes now tell me how much energy and what you can do with it
[16/06/23, 9:37:15 PM] ~ Karan: 9*10^16
[16/06/23, 9:37:59 PM] ~ ✨: 1.602 x 10^-19 Joules.
[16/06/23, 9:38:05 PM] Koushik PEC: 89,875,517,874 mj
[16/06/23, 9:39:00 PM] ThiyagaB: Now back to the question,  what you can do with it, numbers la ok. How much is this energy, in real world what you can do with it
[16/06/23, 9:40:21 PM] ~ ✨: If we have 1 kg of hydrogen.. We can Drive 100Km
[16/06/23, 9:40:55 PM] ThiyagaB: With 9*10^16 you can drive 100km?
[16/06/23, 9:43:20 PM] Koushik PEC: India needs about 500 GW
[16/06/23, 9:44:19 PM] Koushik PEC: so hypothetically this is about 24965.42 GW
[16/06/23, 9:45:18 PM] Koushik PEC: So we could meet India's power requirements for 50 years
[16/06/23, 9:45:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Are you dating with just 1 kg hydrogen, total India ku 50 years
[16/06/23, 9:46:02 PM] ThiyagaB: Saying *
[16/06/23, 9:46:08 PM] Koushik PEC: But that's impossible
[16/06/23, 9:46:18 PM] ThiyagaB: :)
[16/06/23, 9:46:41 PM] ThiyagaB: I will let this open till tomorrow for others to debate on this
[16/06/23, 9:46:47 PM] ~ karthick: Is it 9*10¹⁶ or 9*10¹⁹
[16/06/23, 9:47:08 PM] ThiyagaB: Depends on what unit you are using, km or m
[16/06/23, 9:47:16 PM] Koushik PEC: If we could break atoms and start producing energy it's possible probably
[16/06/23, 9:50:38 PM] ThiyagaB: Ppl any thoughts on koushik answer, even in theory does this makes sense
[16/06/23, 9:51:43 PM] Koushik PEC: Atleast that's what e=mc2 tells about 1kg
[16/06/23, 9:53:34 PM] ThiyagaB: :) let’s see if others agree
[17/06/23, 9:45:10 AM] ~ Karan: It's totally related to speed of light.
[17/06/23, 9:47:10 AM] ~ Karan: If it isn't then possibly 1 kg of hydrogen cover 60miles.
[17/06/23, 9:56:35 AM] ThiyagaB: and its constant anyway
[17/06/23, 8:19:19 PM] ThiyagaB: And yes in theory that’s how much energy you can get from just 1kg, 
And it’s already happening in stars through nuclear fission and fusion, our own Sun gets all its energy through this
[17/06/23, 8:21:40 PM] ThiyagaB: I also believe, young minds most of the time don’t know their potential, like how u answered, 
60 km with 1 kg of hydrogen :) 
But the real potential is way way way higher…
[17/06/23, 8:23:43 PM] Koushik PEC: To be honest I thought of atomic bombs at the first case 😅
[17/06/23, 8:24:18 PM] ThiyagaB: :) yes again its the same nuclear fission in atomic bombs
[17/06/23, 8:34:45 PM] ThiyagaB: Folks,
Lately i see only 10-20% off group actively participate, so like to check with you all once again on your expectations from the group.. 

This time instead of a poll ( which is easier to select :)) , 
I like to see you response here…
[17/06/23, 8:35:29 PM] ThiyagaB: Share your suggestions and ideas too
[17/06/23, 8:39:11 PM] ~ Karthi: We REC guys have our semester exams going on sir..but will definitely try to catch up sir👍🏻
[17/06/23, 8:43:39 PM] ~ ^_^: Even PEC guys exams are gonna start Sir... will surely try to participate and keep this grp active Sir
[17/06/23, 8:44:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Then i will also catch up once you are all ready, it’s a common time for exams to everyone right?
[17/06/23, 8:48:40 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Yeah sir most of the 1st Years are having their exams
[17/06/23, 8:49:09 PM] ThiyagaB: For how long? Till July end?
[17/06/23, 8:49:24 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Till July 24 for pec

[24/06/23, 8:50:24 PM] ~ Karan: No prob
[24/06/23, 9:10:32 PM] ThiyagaB: also do you all have any forum or any other place, where you can post your feedback or problems in college?  
like soru sari illa.. :) 
bus driver could do better. 
lab could be better with these facilities.
[24/06/23, 9:11:18 PM] Koushik PEC: Not sure sir
[24/06/23, 9:12:05 PM] Koushik PEC: Probably they'll tell us to write a letter about the issue (panimalar)
[24/06/23, 9:12:25 PM] ThiyagaB: i saw the reviews ,
https://collegedunia.com/college/24339-panimalar-engineering-college-chennai/reviews
and 
in other sites,
https://www.shiksha.com/college/srm-valliammai-engineering-college-chengalpattu-kattankulathur-chennai-23078/reviews

Every single review talks very good about the college, avlo nallava iruku college lam ??
[24/06/23, 9:12:50 PM] ~ karthick: No sir .  But they will ask feedback about faculties every semester (Valliammai Engineering college)
[24/06/23, 9:12:52 PM] ThiyagaB: hahahaha..  also.. i can see the response from students, when i said, morning tiffen was good..
[24/06/23, 9:13:36 PM] ThiyagaB: you give genuine feedback?  but none of these feedbacks are public la..  so it helps other ppl
[24/06/23, 9:15:07 PM] ~ karthick: Maybe 😂 . Yes sir. The feedback is private.
[24/06/23, 9:15:54 PM] ~ Karthi: Per semester they will conduct a feedback session sir ! We can tell  our individual feedback in that session sir!(REC)
[24/06/23, 9:16:03 PM] ThiyagaB: appo indha reviews la yaaru podra.. are they all genuine??
[24/06/23, 9:16:21 PM] ThiyagaB: Oh good.. REC does better than i expected..
[24/06/23, 9:17:43 PM] Koushik PEC: In my college some teachers do it personally not from the management side sir
[24/06/23, 9:18:10 PM] ~ ^_^: Romba nalla college Sir...best food..nalla teachers.. enjoyment..100% placements🙂
[24/06/23, 9:19:17 PM] ~ ^_^: Parents than Sir..

[24/06/23, 9:20:33 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Neenga clg pathi keka start paningana we'll start ranting💀
[24/06/23, 9:20:37 PM] ThiyagaB: i believe a strong open feedback is the only way any system can improve..   every system has challenges, there is no 100% perfect place,  if your college has these forums and receive and work on feedback.. then you all are lucky..

so all i ask is, are they all genuine.. and they encourage criticism and feedback?
[24/06/23, 9:20:48 PM] ThiyagaB: genuine rant is welcome :)
[24/06/23, 9:21:15 PM] ~ ^_^: Venam Sir.. ungalukke veruppa aayidum🥲
[24/06/23, 9:21:38 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Not really sir
They'll start cornering us if we raise any suggestions
[24/06/23, 9:22:17 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Or even if we ask about any changes to be taken in clg it would be neglected
[24/06/23, 9:22:20 PM] ThiyagaB: :) usual la.. mostly.. even in companies it happens..
[24/06/23, 9:22:49 PM] ~ ^_^: They support students Sir...if a complaint is raised against a teacher...he/she is monitored very keenly
[24/06/23, 9:23:21 PM] ThiyagaB: oh then students wont open their mouth to complain right
[24/06/23, 9:23:38 PM] ~ ^_^: Old is gold maari athe backward thinking irukku sir 🥲
[24/06/23, 9:24:08 PM] ~ ^_^: No no...like Hod and senior officials will monitor the teacher Sir
[24/06/23, 9:24:25 PM] ThiyagaB: ohh like that ok ok..
[24/06/23, 9:24:31 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: 1. Phones not allowed
2. Girls boys no interaction
3. Strict dress codes especially for girls u gotta cover ur whole body orelese it would provoke boys to look at you
[24/06/23, 9:24:40 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: 😂3rd point is fun sir
[24/06/23, 9:24:47 PM] ThiyagaB: this is for sure.. 100% agreed.   I was actually surprised to see the ideologies are 3 decades old
[24/06/23, 9:25:00 PM] ThiyagaB: and its 2023 ..
[24/06/23, 9:25:06 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Yeah sir it's coz of the current management
[24/06/23, 9:25:11 PM] ~ ^_^: Girls ku mattum full black la varalam..naanga vandha "ennada strike panna poringala"🙂
[24/06/23, 9:25:35 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Now we aren't allowed to wear white pants coz it will look transparent 🤣
[24/06/23, 9:25:39 PM] ~ .^.: yes
[24/06/23, 9:25:49 PM] ThiyagaB: which college you are?
[24/06/23, 9:26:17 PM] ~ .^.: Sairam
[24/06/23, 9:26:26 PM] Koushik PEC: Every process takes insanely more time sir
[24/06/23, 9:26:42 PM] Koushik PEC: Like they do everything manually
[24/06/23, 9:26:50 PM] ThiyagaB: Many colleges teach students to respect and encourage collaboration with other genders..  and these ppl gel well when they work in companies..
[24/06/23, 9:26:51 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: If college doesn't teach us about basic gender equality how can we manage in work place sir ? Won't we be used to the same ideology that we had in clg
[24/06/23, 9:27:41 PM] ThiyagaB: yes agreed.   this is one of the sad thing.. i have seen freshers struggling hard to talk , paavama irukum..
[24/06/23, 9:27:54 PM] Koushik PEC: They are just using parents insecurity of their children to market their seats sir
[24/06/23, 9:27:58 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Kandipa panimalar pasanga thaa avanga😂
[24/06/23, 9:28:06 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Totally agree
[24/06/23, 9:28:22 PM] ThiyagaB: hahah there are other colleges too i guess.. 

how is sairam, valliammai?
[24/06/23, 9:31:29 PM] ~ .^.: Same rules sir girls boys no interaction
[24/06/23, 9:31:45 PM] ~ .^.: But phones are allowed
[24/06/23, 9:31:46 PM] ThiyagaB: ada paavigala.. i thought so high of sairam
[24/06/23, 9:32:03 PM] ~ .^.: 🙃
[24/06/23, 9:32:56 PM] ~ karthick: Valliammai is ok . But they will never improve the infrastructure like lab and classrooms. Gender and dress code are not an issue sir.
[24/06/23, 9:33:10 PM] ~ ^_^: Enna irundhalum PEC ah beat panna mudiyathu 🙂
[24/06/23, 9:33:25 PM] ThiyagaB: The facilities may be poor in govt. colleges, but one good thing is very less of these rules..    CEG la no rules at all as far as i know..
[24/06/23, 9:33:57 PM] ThiyagaB: btw do you guys know 'glassdoor' site for company reviews..
[24/06/23, 9:34:11 PM] Koushik PEC: Yes sir
[24/06/23, 9:34:58 PM] ThiyagaB: if there is 'glassdoor' like anonymous ( but genuine ) reviews for our colleges..  how useful it will be?
[24/06/23, 9:35:51 PM] Koushik PEC: That's what clg meme pages Do sir
[24/06/23, 9:35:58 PM] ~ Karan: Theriyathu sir
[24/06/23, 9:36:09 PM] ThiyagaB: it sends a strong 'real' feedback to colleges, so they will improve.. 

but clg memes are just for fun, they arent serious right?
[24/06/23, 9:36:52 PM] Koushik PEC: we can try sir
[24/06/23, 9:38:00 PM] ThiyagaB: i mean a college wont bother about these memes,   
but as a company i am serious about the reviews ppl post about me in 'glassdoor',  and i keep improving myself.. without these feedback loop. systems will be stuck in old ages.
[24/06/23, 9:38:42 PM] ThiyagaB: @918525824924 avlo rant paniye.. anonymousa podlamna.. u ll rant there too ? :)
[24/06/23, 9:39:10 PM] Koushik PEC: We could sir but anonymous platforms can easily be exploited right sir
[24/06/23, 9:39:13 PM] ~ 👑: Per month they will conduct a feedback session sir .......kcet
[24/06/23, 9:39:59 PM] ThiyagaB: exactly..  it should have a proper moderation and also a very genuine objective with no profit motive..  i am validating these thoughts still.. want to hear from you all
[24/06/23, 9:43:06 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: 😂I won't rant there but would point out the issues that we're facing and maybe give some suggestions too
[24/06/23, 9:43:17 PM] ThiyagaB: nalla pullaya irukka ..
[24/06/23, 9:43:34 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: 😂pugalchi pidikathu sir
[24/06/23, 9:44:21 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: We would love to have the same thing in our clg sir but I don't think our college would accept for this
[24/06/23, 9:44:46 PM] ~ ^_^: Enna pannalum namma college la rules maatha maatanga😂
[24/06/23, 9:44:47 PM] ThiyagaB: college en accept pannanum.. this is a neutral site, any student can login
[24/06/23, 9:45:26 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Ila sir ipo nanga issues raise pana opposite la kekanum or respond pananum la
[24/06/23, 9:46:18 PM] ~ .^.: But enna dhan panalum maaradhu sir actual ah 3 years back ipo irukuradha vida romba strict ah irundhanga adhuku idhu far better
[24/06/23, 9:46:36 PM] ThiyagaB: yes.. adhuku dhan i told about 'glassdoor' this site is for genuine reviews about companies.. so before we join, we always check these reviews, understand about company and take decision.

Now if college management knows there are real genuine reviews by many ppl, and others also refer to it in public.. they have to
[24/06/23, 9:47:18 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Yes sir
[24/06/23, 9:47:51 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Then that would be useful for us too

[24/06/23, 10:11:31 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha, yes you are paying, and you are not allowed to give feedback.. 
here in companies we are getting paid, still we give strong open feedback
[24/06/23, 10:17:11 PM] ~ Karan: 😂🤣
[24/06/23, 10:17:23 PM] ~ Karan: Maybe that's y they r paying.
[24/06/23, 10:28:05 PM] ~ Karan: We are getting nothing and giving feedback for no use.

Coming after a month break is always interesting, 
We will now know who are really interested :) 
Let’s see how many votes we get
[01/08/23, 8:58:07 PM] ThiyagaB: Wow i targeted 25 votes.. and we got it :) 

Let’s resume… Hope all are doing ok, back from a month of continuous exams
[01/08/23, 9:04:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw recently i was discussing with my old college friends and we were talking on how we *passed* the exams. 

We had one very studious guy, and just few days before the exams we will ask him to explain the key concepts ( like story telling ), just with those stories we passed all the exams :) and we are forever indebted to that guy.


So question is , 
In this generation, you guys still survive with simple stories on these subjects? Or you all study?
[01/08/23, 9:05:06 PM] ~ Karan: None of these
[01/08/23, 9:05:12 PM] ~ Karan: Only with important
[01/08/23, 9:06:18 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: We study only the important questions or the question bank given by staffs
[01/08/23, 9:07:02 PM] Koushik PEC: My clg is loyal in this case,they provide us like 20 questions from which we can manage to get 75%
[01/08/23, 9:07:34 PM] ThiyagaB: Cha superrr :)
[01/08/23, 9:08:39 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Oru secret solren sir 
Sometimes we even receive the question paper but not officially 🏃🏼‍♀
[01/08/23, 9:09:07 PM] ThiyagaB: Ada paavigala
[01/08/23, 9:23:48 PM] ThiyagaB: I was doing 'Booster classes' for students,

For example your 4th semester has 'Database Management Systems' , so based on the unit topics, i can explain key concepts with real industry examples, so you understand it better and will help in your exams too.  

Will this "Booster classes" work for this group? Let me know we can plan.
[01/08/23, 9:24:22 PM] Koushik PEC: Sure sir
[01/08/23, 9:25:47 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Yes sir
[01/08/23, 9:25:50 PM] ThiyagaB: you are 'default' sure i know :)

[01/08/23, 9:37:40 PM] ~ 👑: Sir ...our dept will give the original qstn paper of every internal and model exam ....before that day.  .. 


We will study that particular given  qstns .....

And sem qstn almost cover our internal qstns .....
[01/08/23, 9:38:27 PM] ThiyagaB: With all due respect to our institutions..  The question bank culture doesnt help students to understand the subjects, but just get marks :( 

and if done right, learning the key concepts right , is easier than the question bank model to score better.
[01/08/23, 9:41:10 PM] ThiyagaB: To better plan these 'booster classes' i need 1 or 2 volunteers from each college, 

Panimalar i already have @919500144487

[02/08/23, 8:47:33 PM] ThiyagaB: Hi ppl, 

Lets resume our quiz time,  since we start after long time,  this question is not analytical, logical or mathematical question.   Its more about human connections, and we used to ask this to understand how empathetic a person is. 

There is no definite answer, its all left to your imagination.

*How would you describe Sunset to a visually impaired person* ‎<This message was edited>
[02/08/23, 8:50:19 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Should we describe how it feels or how it looks sir?
[02/08/23, 8:50:20 PM] ThiyagaB: and a good answer gets 50₹
[02/08/23, 8:50:54 PM] ThiyagaB: upto you, you have a visually impaired friend, how do u explain to him, ur feel depends on how it looks right :) ? ‎<This message was edited>
[02/08/23, 8:53:09 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: It's the time when the warmth leaves slowly and the slight cold night starts and birds that was chirping the whole day gets back to its home and the cycle repeats everyday
[02/08/23, 8:53:49 PM] Koushik PEC: So basically we can give him 2 balls and explain him how sun and earth works. To explain how sunlight works i would compare it with sound as it is much more relevant to light then I'll start explaining him about sun light and colours
[02/08/23, 8:55:52 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: The scenario is the world gets into the dark and coldness and the sun slowly disappears.  It's like the sun going into the ocean. ‎<This message was edited>
[02/08/23, 8:55:56 PM] ~ ^_^: I will let him feel the temperature and the air when the sun sets as it varies from sunrise to sunset
[02/08/23, 8:57:02 PM] ~ ^_^: And to give him an experience I would use flashlight infront of his eyes and slowly reduce it to dim and switch it off....
[02/08/23, 8:59:29 PM] ~ ^_^: He is visually impaired..so he'll not be familiar with colours.
[02/08/23, 8:59:33 PM] ThiyagaB: you guys are awesome really..    complete different perspectives,   someone explains in most emotional way, the other scientific, ..  will wait for more responses.
[02/08/23, 9:00:36 PM] ThiyagaB: and also sun dont go into the ocean right :)  what if he is bengaluru.. u dont get to see sun going into ocean
[02/08/23, 9:01:25 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Yes 
But Just imagination
[02/08/23, 9:05:39 PM] Koushik PEC: We can compare light with sound sir like darkness to silence and brightness to some high volume sound as sound and light has mostly similar properties then he could imagine sun like a sphere which emits some like sound which revolves around earth so this happens
[02/08/23, 9:11:02 PM] ~ Arun: Sir can I try in tamil
[02/08/23, 9:15:13 PM] ThiyagaB: Absolutely
[02/08/23, 9:17:22 PM] ~ Arun: அது ஒரு அழகிய மாலை பொழுது அப்போது பறவைகள் கீச் சத்ததுடன் வானில்  உலாவும் அந்த நேரத்தில் குளிர்ந்த காற்று வீசி மனதை வருடும் மற்றும் வானம் செவப்பு நிறத்தில் ஜோலித்து  பூங்காடு போல மிகவும் அழகாய் இருக்கும்

Visually impaired people are not blind they can't see certain degrees
[02/08/23, 9:18:19 PM] ~ Harish.EA: A visually impaired person has a blind stick in his hand that would play a major role like a guide  which will help them to feel what  are the thing they touch and what arround us . For normal people sun also like the guide which guide with his light too show all the things present in this surroundings.when a blind stick is lost they not able find what  are things around   them  like that  after the sunset surrounding looks dark l the normal people lost the guide  sun so that we not feel and differentiate what are things around us and also when the blind lost his stick and walking in street some will help them to tell what around us like that the night  electric light  are like that only
[02/08/23, 9:19:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Ennada aalaluku kalakreenga 👏

[04/08/23, 8:06:27 PM] Product Manager: Kindly give an explanation
[04/08/23, 8:06:51 PM] ThiyagaB: Why not B
[04/08/23, 8:07:42 PM] Koushik PEC: Cats are grouped under mamals so the inherit the properties on mammals furry in this case
[04/08/23, 8:11:34 PM] ~ 👑: All mammals are furry
&
All furry animals are mammals

b) some cats are furry. ....wrong ....bcoz all cats are furry...
d) all furry animals are mammals....wrong...bcoz birds have fur to keep them warm

c) some furry animals are cats.......

Cats have fur. But All mammals have fur including humans and elephants. 

So that's why option c.....

https://nas.io/codesapiens/booster-class---data-structures-and-algorithm

Please go ahead and register, we are mostly targeting second year students,  but third year also can join.

We expect atleast 25-50 participants for this session to be successful,  So share it across your group.
[05/08/23, 6:30:36 PM] ThiyagaB: I always tell students, how 'Programming' is one of the skill with which you can create cool stuff from your laptop and reach the world and earn millions.

Here is the short story of the popular game 'Wordle' Josh created for fun for his wife, 


Wordle was created by Josh Wardle, a software engineer in Brooklyn, for fun. He originally made it for his partner, Palak Shah, who loves word games. The game quickly became popular among Wardle's friends and family, and he eventually released it to the public in October 2021.

In January 2022, Wordle was acquired by The New York Times for an undisclosed price in the low seven figures ( more than a million dollar) . 

Wordle is a simple but addictive word game that has captured the attention of millions of people around the world. It is a great example of how a creative and well-made game can go viral
[05/08/23, 6:30:52 PM] ThiyagaB: How many of you know or play wordle

[07/08/23, 9:34:51 PM] ThiyagaB: Folks, get ready for today's quiz and those who solve first with proper explanation gets 50₹ today ( since there are lots of new folks )
[07/08/23, 9:36:05 PM] ThiyagaB: *Quiz Question*
You need to travel from Place A to Place B and have two options:

Option 1 (Highway Route): This route is 100 km long and has a toll of ₹50. Your car gives a mileage of 20 km per liter on the highway.

Option 2 (City Route): This route is 80 km long and has no toll. Your car gives a mileage of 15 km per liter in the city.

Given that petrol costs ₹100 per liter, which route will cost you less, and how much will the entire trip cost for each option?

[07/08/23, 9:37:30 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: Option 2 because 80/15*100 is approx 533

[07/08/23, 9:38:07 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: And option 1 costs 550 ie 100/20*100+50
[07/08/23, 9:38:21 PM] ~ Adithya🖤: Option 2: costs 533
[07/08/23, 9:38:26 PM] ~ Santhosh: 1st option will total cost of ₹550
Since 100/20=5 litres so 500 rs +50 toll
So totally 550
2nd  option will cost 80/15=5.33
So 5.33 x 100 = 533 rs
So 17rs profit in option 2( city route) ‎<This message was edited>

5*100= 500
500+50= 550

Option 2
80/15=5.33
5.33*100=533

Option 2 is less cost
[07/08/23, 9:41:58 PM] ~ Sivanipriya🦋: Option2 costs 533 and option1 costs 550 . They prefer option2 as rs.17 profit from option1

‎[07/08/23, 9:44:06 PM] ~ shriram: ‎sticker omitted
[07/08/23, 9:44:18 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Option 1 (Highway Route):
Cost = (Distance / Mileage) * Fuel Price + Toll
Cost = (100 km / 20 km/l) * ₹100/l + ₹50
Cost = ₹500 + ₹50
Cost = ₹550

Option 2 (City Route):
Cost = (Distance / Mileage) * Fuel Price
Cost = (80 km / 15 km/l) * ₹100/l
Cost = ₹533.33

Therefore, the City Route (Option 2) will cost you less, with a total cost of approximately ₹533.33, while the Highway Route (Option 1) will cost you ₹550.
[07/08/23, 9:44:43 PM] ThiyagaB: I am watching the group to settle, to share the reward,

This group is created mainly for students and no need to be very formal like in college :)
[07/08/23, 9:45:04 PM] ~ Dukatu: Option 1 costs (100/20)*100 + 50(for toll) which is 550
Option 2 costs (80/15)*100 which is 533
So option 2 costs less

[08/08/23, 9:17:28 PM] ThiyagaB: Definitely,  its just the most popular used, and there is another ranking which shows the "highly paid salary" languages, and i have never once used the top 5 :)
[08/08/23, 9:18:24 PM] ThiyagaB: still the OS and related layers are coded in C, so security la yes..  OS specific coding la, network related la   C innum gethu dhan
[08/08/23, 9:18:51 PM] Koushik PEC: Without proper understanding in c or other low level languages u can't understand what's happening in memory kind of stuff bro u can use c to get ur hand dirty on registers kind of concepts
[08/08/23, 9:19:29 PM] Koushik PEC: Even Linux is in c sir and used by most of the servers today
[08/08/23, 9:20:02 PM] ThiyagaB: 20 years back naangalum adhan padichom :)
[08/08/23, 9:21:58 PM] ThiyagaB: C is still king in core areas, but for lazy programmers like me, 
I love python
[08/08/23, 9:22:51 PM] Koushik PEC: We can still like play with c like making and breaking stuff

[08/08/23, 9:36:20 PM] ~ ^_^: They only give u a website or design based on their coding... alterations are done only by the user...and not every app or AI Tools think the way we do
[08/08/23, 9:37:06 PM] Koushik PEC: U can use it for assistance let's take chatgpt it has contents only still 2021
[08/08/23, 9:37:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Good question,

1. Even for bard and chatgpt they need a website and web pages, 
So web is everywhere

2. AI just assist, it can’t create a big project like your bookmyshow etc..  may be in 5 years they might
[08/08/23, 9:39:25 PM] Koushik PEC: Humans are good at real time problem solving which is lacking in ai they can only produce answers to past problems
[08/08/23, 9:40:07 PM] ~ ^_^: It depends on us how we design it based on our ideas or use it...for example if Sir books a movie ticket for us na..jollyah movie poitu paathitu varalam... ipdi than AI efficient ah use pannalam

[09/08/23, 8:24:47 PM] ThiyagaB: Hi ppl, Today's quiz, this is easy and also a  bit tricky, dont need an exact answer, but just the approach
[09/08/23, 8:27:44 PM] ThiyagaB: Software Industry is soo important to Indian economy because of the job opportunities and the revenue the industry generates every year.

Now I need you to find *how much average revenue per person*, software industry contributes to India. 
Please note: This is not the average salary per person, this is the average revenue generated per person.
[09/08/23, 8:28:15 PM] ThiyagaB: Quiz Reward:  30₹. For right method of calculation and approx right number, whoever says first
[09/08/23, 8:30:47 PM] ~ ^_^: 1% of India's GNP?
[09/08/23, 8:31:09 PM] ThiyagaB: I want the revenue in Indian Rupee.. like how much lakhs per year per person ‎<This message was edited>
[09/08/23, 8:31:21 PM] ~ Santhosh: Total software industry worth of india is 140billion usd
Over 6million developers are there
So about 20-24k usd is the average revenue generated by person in india
[09/08/23, 8:32:52 PM] ~ ^_^: Around 16-18 lakhs per year
[09/08/23, 8:33:24 PM] ~ Santhosh: In terms of direct conversion to lakhs 16lak-19.2lak
[09/08/23, 8:33:36 PM] Koushik PEC: Around 20 lakhs
[09/08/23, 8:33:47 PM] Koushik PEC: Inr
[09/08/23, 8:36:19 PM] ThiyagaB: approach plz
[09/08/23, 8:36:47 PM] Koushik PEC: 1min sir trying a different approach
[09/08/23, 8:38:49 PM] ~ shriram: Revenue generated by Indian software sector is 245 billion usd
Ppl working In IT sector 2.8 million In India
So on an avg 74 lacs inr per person ‎<This message was edited>

[09/08/23, 8:42:13 PM] Koushik PEC: If the it industry is worth 140b the tax generated is 14b (10% on avg) so divided with 6 million devs so on a average a person contributes 1.9 lakhs to the government
[09/08/23, 8:42:13 PM] ~ Santhosh: As per wiki,
Combining IT and bpm industries one year -245 billion dollars
With 5.4million people
So as per this nearly 45-46lakh inr is the average revenue generated per person in india
[09/08/23, 8:42:42 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Software industries contribute to India's GDP is around 7 percent, India's total GDP is around 3.18 trillion dollars , total IT employees in India is 2.18 millions so as per the calculation average revenue per person software industries contribute to India is around 65 lakhs rupees ‎<This message was edited>

[09/08/23, 8:43:14 PM] ThiyagaB: haha.. good one..  but for the question, we focus only on revenue..  Direct and indirect taxes are bit complex , ippodhaiku out of scope namaku :)
[09/08/23, 8:46:03 PM] ThiyagaB: btw you seems to be a new entrant.. which college and year you are from?
[09/08/23, 8:46:30 PM] Koushik PEC: Actually I thought of calculating all the indirect taxes too by the developers 😅

[09/08/23, 8:47:27 PM] ThiyagaB: “The Hardest Thing in the World to Understand is Income Tax” -Albert Einstein.   

:). if you can do it.. sama mass..
[09/08/23, 8:47:34 PM] ~ Arun: As per Google
IT industry revenue includes export and domestic is 245 billion USD in 2023 fy
And 5.4 million employees
It comes around 36-38 lakh per year in Indian rupee
[09/08/23, 8:48:23 PM] Koushik PEC: Just estimates sir they pay indirect taxes like every other common man
[09/08/23, 8:48:42 PM] ThiyagaB: Good try everyone..   the main motive of the question is for you guys to understand the importance of software industry for India, and how much each of us contribute..  So instead of a message, thought of asking it as quiz. 

All of you gave right try..    
But @917449098415  Got it first.. so he gets the reward for today..

[09/08/23, 8:49:43 PM] ThiyagaB: So on an average 30-40 lakhs per year  per person is the revenue generated and this is the highest per person for any industry in india.
[09/08/23, 8:55:36 PM] ThiyagaB: @917449098415 hope you got it.

And all,  the reward is just a small amount to encourage you all to participate.  More than the money, its just that little joy of winning and learning matters  
 As i said earlier, we will ask a quiz every alternate days after 8-9pm. 
So be ready :)

[11/08/23, 8:06:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Quiz:

Nanda is faced with a staircase of 10 steps. Being a quirky climber, he can climb by taking either 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many unique ways can Nanda climb to the top?

For e.g. 3 steps, he can climb 1,2 or 2,1 or 1,1,1 . so 3 ways.  Similarly for 10 steps how many ways.

[11/08/23, 8:22:57 PM] ThiyagaB: You got it?
[11/08/23, 8:24:25 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: for 1 double step and 8 single steps : 9! /8! = 9 . For 2 double steps and 6 single steps : 8! /2×6! = 28. For 3 double steps and 4 single steps : 7! /4! ×3! = 35. for 4 double steps and 2 single steps : 6! /4! ×2! = 15. For 5 double steps, we have 1. Then 1+9+28+35+15+1=89

[13/08/23, 6:03:30 PM] ThiyagaB: In our earlier sessions or quiz, I emphasised on the need to understand the business perspective of everything around us. 

Whether it’s  
GenAI
Elon vs Mark fights
Our Engineering colleges 
Movies

There is always a business angle to it. So today’s quiz is to see how you guys understand this system of business. 

It’s an open ended question ( which means no single answer) , whoever gives a better one gets reward
[13/08/23, 6:05:30 PM] ThiyagaB: Quiz:

What are the Business strategies used to maximise the *profit* for *Jailer movie*?

Please don’t criticise or talk about any person. The analysis should purely be from business angle.
Give me precisely 3-4 points, ( Tamil also fine)

The reward is based on the depth and true facts and analysis. 

Take your time, we have two hours till 8pm
[13/08/23, 6:09:36 PM] Koushik PEC: Optimize the number of screens getting published
[13/08/23, 6:10:12 PM] ~ Sanjay Ganesh: The movie team conducted a grand audio launch
They kept posting the positive reviews from the famous person like Stalin and Vijay 
Releasing trailer cuts and clips
Sharing box office collection
The memes were positive and the top YouTube channels haven't posted any negative comments
[13/08/23, 6:10:27 PM] Koushik PEC: Sir is the profit we are talking about is to the producer or the cinema owners??
[13/08/23, 6:10:59 PM] ~ Santhosh: 1) introducing a movie when no other big movie is released so that everyone will be watching this. So that number of screens will be more in each theatre.
2)audio launch concerts are for promoting movie
3) frequent ads about movies on tv channels
4) youtube - music, trailer , teaser keep the audience waiting so that when the movie releases everyone wants to see it..
[13/08/23, 6:11:23 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Promotional activities like audio launch, using social media influencers to promote .
Keeping audience in the edge of the seat till the release by releasing songs, bts videos 
Using a huge starcast that would bring different fanbase audience all together 
Releasing the movie during holiday times so many of us would watch this will increase the screen bookings 
Finding the right time to release the movie especially  family audience can watch
[13/08/23, 6:11:24 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Release promo in famous tv, theatres ( sun tv) frequently
Anirudh bgms vachi ads panni, tv la podalaam
Kavalaya , thalaivar alaparai songs vachi ads pannalaam


Get positive reviews and put in promo, five generations aa thalaivar aa celebrate panraanga...

[13/08/23, 6:11:33 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: -Create movie suitable for all age groups so that the walk-in audience is more
-creating hype with the help of audio launches and social media platforms
-adding more number of famous people to the cast to increase the hype as well as bringing in cameos so that even the other language fans are interested in it(no spoilet iykyk) 
-increasing the number of shows in multiplexes as well as releasing it throughout the world even dubbed in languages like china opens its market out of india totoo
-using  a music composer who is relevant and can deliver suitable songs for this generation
-using multiple publicity hooks like the Kaavala song to captivate the youthXD
-having a famous production which can provide large funds which increases the quality of the film's output.
-releasing the movie in a dormant time where there is no competition so that the whole market share is contributed to a single movie ‎<This message was edited>
[13/08/23, 6:11:34 PM] ThiyagaB: Everyone invested in the movie.

In any business there are always multiple stakeholders invested.

[13/08/23, 6:14:09 PM] ~ Kissssorre: Commissioning YouTube channels to give positive reviews about the movie
Increasing the expectations using glimpses
Advertising the movie world wide ex: screening the teaser on bhuj kalifa tower
[13/08/23, 6:14:35 PM] ~ Ram: Promotions played a major role in jailer's success. They were keen on promoting the movie in its right way by publishing great poster design and rombhave impressive music works and creative promos. The hype created by the speeches in audio launch and masterpiece HUKUM song which brought back the hidden rajinism in all. More than that through memes though it's +ve or ve- the talk about the movie is still on. Proper portrayal of movie essence in trailer and great reviews and wom created magic in box office. There is no big clash for this movie so they managed to get maximum screens
[13/08/23, 6:15:43 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: 1.The producer is sun tv . As they have the high trp ratings , they easily promoted the movie.
2.To make it as a pan India movie , they cast big stars across languages.
3.They utilize the fight between the two big shots in kollywood(superstar issue).
4.It is the first movie in Tamil Nadu to release in 1000 screens (may be the impact of red giants).
5.They play the songs in fm (suryan fm) frequently.
6.The release date , they release on Thursday so the diehard  fans  occupy seats in first two days and next two are weekends and a day after that is a holiday (Independence day).
7.No other  movies released on that day.
[13/08/23, 6:16:12 PM] ThiyagaB: Good one, the timing of release is also important
[13/08/23, 6:16:12 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: . Added some extra points
[13/08/23, 6:16:36 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes for all age groups , though the movie was bit violent
[13/08/23, 6:17:10 PM] ~ Subhash Krishnasamy: One of the different strategies which turned out effective was the lyrics of the *Hukum* song... Though the song had lyrics which triggered certain set of an audience it became effective in promoting the movie in various aspects like Memes,media etc...
Other promotions, release time of movie,glimpses
Casting front line actors from all the industries even for cameo roles etc were other strategies which made the movie a banger.

[13/08/23, 6:17:35 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: It has now become a major part of Indian cinema as a whole. People in general are no longer interested in Dramatic acting and movies.
[13/08/23, 6:18:09 PM] ~ Usha: 1.Superstar has a massive market in INDIA
2.Ofcourse the number of screens is large(approx 6500 worldwide)
3.Movie promotions are executed finely
4.Songs were greatly attracted and reached 
5.Three language stars were collaborated 
6.Castings are good etc,...
[13/08/23, 6:18:13 PM] ~ 🥳: 1. Pan india casting
2.Comparing beast with jailor.
3.Sagotharar Vijay controversy in audio launch.
4. Tamannah's Kaavala
5.padayappa neelambari reunion hype

[13/08/23, 6:21:53 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Update pannirken sir
[13/08/23, 6:25:00 PM] ThiyagaB: This multiple generation is one strategy too yes 👍🏼
[13/08/23, 6:25:05 PM] ~ ^_^: Best business strategy is adding Super Start Rajinikanth to this movie
[13/08/23, 6:25:12 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: 😇
[13/08/23, 6:26:04 PM] ~ ❣️Medha.M.J❣️: ‎~ ❣️Medha.M.J❣️ left
[13/08/23, 6:28:47 PM] SHIVABALAN MANI🦂: I think these factors contributes majorly for the success of Jailer 

1) Excellent promotions and updates :

Right from the announcement and preview of the movie, there was a huge hype for this movie. People were manipulated to believe that the movie will be an audiovisual treat and this attracted audience!

The constant updates they gave since the announcement was also a major thing in the success. They literally made the audience wait for the movie eagerly. They triggered the emotions of the audience with their updates and promotions that included the Grand Audio Launch and also the songs gave them an epic reach!


2) Making use of  hero's strong zone :

As we all know Rajini is an action and a commercial hero and this script perfectly suits him since it is his zone! So the selection of a hero for the script  is one of the primary reasons for the success of the movie!

3) Choice of cast which helped them reach multiple regions :

They chose actors from multiple industries. Mohanlal from Mollywood, Jackie Shroff from Hindi , Shiva Rajkumar from Kannada industry. This attracted audiences from multiple regions and played a huge role in collection. So the casting played a major role in the movie’s success!

:) ‎<This message was edited>
[13/08/23, 6:36:07 PM] Koushik PEC: I think the above mentioned points can carry the movie for first 2 days then the script screenplay and story or the quality of the overall movie carries the movie further (PS: opinion from a movie noob)
[13/08/23, 6:37:35 PM] ~ Manoj: 1.Releasing the movie in Thursday so that thalaivar fans will come to  the movie in Thursday and Friday and general audience will be watching on week days (Saturday and Sunday)
2.Casting a multi starer crew so that collection s would be made across India 
3.For first few weeks the theatre will be occupied by rajini fans and then the film goes well based on the script, the director added elements in the movie which attracts family audience like a song which connects father and son etc ...
4.The trailer cut which gave a lead to the movie that a normal person turns into rude which resembles rajini old movies like baatsha so that audience became more interested towards the film
[13/08/23, 6:37:36 PM] ThiyagaB: Superr da, do you write any blogs?

[13/08/23, 6:46:55 PM] ~ ^_^: One more business strategy is releasing kaavala song before the movie🕺🏻
[13/08/23, 7:01:12 PM] ~ Lingeshwaran.V: 1. Thay have created a statement that will be the director's comeback
2. They a created a hype during its promotion
3. They have given a simple statement in exaggerated form so people will go and see what is really done it in and it is mainly based on our people's mentally

[14/08/23, 8:17:14 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Fact sir
[14/08/23, 8:17:52 PM] ThiyagaB: I expected this level of accuracy only, since you tried at this level.. 

I will wait for even more accurate answer and if possible a mathematical explanation rather than adjusting watch :)
[14/08/23, 8:18:13 PM] ThiyagaB: Yaarum sollalaina, nanda is the winner
[14/08/23, 8:18:43 PM] Koushik PEC: Just pattern recognition sir this happens every 1hr 5mins
[14/08/23, 8:19:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Not exactly.. if you want to say it even more precisely
[14/08/23, 8:20:02 PM] Koushik PEC: That differs on the device we use sir
[14/08/23, 8:21:36 PM] Koushik PEC: To be even more precise the frequency of the quartz crystal used in every time piece will have negligible difference which causes this
[14/08/23, 8:21:57 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: The clock hands rotate for 360° for every 30° of the hour and minute hand they coincide
[14/08/23, 8:23:02 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: So they coincide 11 times in 12hrs

[14/08/23, 8:23:32 PM] ~ ^_^: Sirr 1hr 5mins 40seconds 4000 milliseconds   3,000,000 microseconds
[14/08/23, 8:24:14 PM] ~ Raghul V: The time would be 3:16:22 when they meet again 😝
[14/08/23, 8:25:02 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: The hands overlap about every 65 minutes, not every 60 minutes
[14/08/23, 8:26:21 PM] ThiyagaB: The assumption is it’s a perfect clock and also if you do it mathematically including the exact position of hour hand when minute is at 3:15,
[14/08/23, 8:26:59 PM] ThiyagaB: Explanation?
[14/08/23, 8:27:03 PM] ~ Harshu: it overlap ever 65mins and 27seconds hend 3 time it overlap it would a min more hence 3.16
[14/08/23, 8:27:18 PM] ~ sharada: it's not the neatest, but i hope it makes sense! second last line should be 330t = 360 , not 310. ‎<This message was edited>
[14/08/23, 8:28:06 PM] ~ Raghul V: Logically when it is 3:15 the hour hand is after the minutes hand
[14/08/23, 8:28:29 PM] ThiyagaB: Explanation for 22 secs
[14/08/23, 8:29:28 PM] ~ ^_^: Is it based on the semi rotation it takes ???
[14/08/23, 8:29:43 PM] ~ Raghul V: The hour hand nd the minute hand meets at 98.18181818181818 angle
[14/08/23, 8:29:54 PM] ~ sharada: time difference of 12/11 hours simplifies to 1 hour, 5 minutes and 27ish seconds.
[14/08/23, 8:30:21 PM] ThiyagaB: Nice 👏👏
[14/08/23, 8:30:46 PM] ~ Raghul V: So if we convert it to minutes it would be 16.36363636363636 minutes
[14/08/23, 8:31:16 PM] ~ Raghul V: If we convert the remaining minute to seconds it gives 22 seconds
[14/08/23, 8:32:14 PM] ThiyagaB: What Is that remaining one? 
16.36 to 22 seconds epdi
[14/08/23, 8:32:25 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw this is the right one

[14/08/23, 8:33:43 PM] ~ sharada: i used a computer for calculation full disclosure 😅

[14/08/23, 8:35:58 PM] ThiyagaB: 12/11 if you used computer to convert to hours and mins thats fine

[15/08/23, 9:41:20 PM] ~ Mathumitha Mathiyalagan: மேகத்திர்கும் மனம் உண்டு..... அதன் மனம் உடைந்து மழையாய் கொட்டித்தீர்தது...... மழலைக்கும்  மனம் உண்டு..... அதன் மனம் மழையை பார்த்து மகிழ்ந்தது..... உடைந்த மேகத்தை பார்த்து மகிழ்வதே உலகத்தின் விடை தெரியா தேடலின் விடையா..... இல்லை...... மத்தாப்பைப் போன்ற தொடர் கதையா

பாசத்தைக் கொட்டும் பணிமழையும் அல்ல...!
 வெருப்பைக் கொட்டும் நெருப்பு மழையாய் இருப்பின் என்ன..?
என்னை மழலை ஆக்கிய மந்திர மழை நீ...!
உன் வருகையில் புன்னகை தந்தாய்...!
மறைவில் ஏமாற்றம் தந்தாய்...!
வாழ்ந்த அச்சிரிய காலத்தில்
என்னையே எனக்கு மீட்டுத் தந்த
மந்திர மத்தாப்பு நீ...!!

[16/08/23, 8:15:24 PM] ~ 🥳: In this case, the radius is diminished by 17%. So, the area of the circle will be diminished by (17%)^2 = 2.89%.(area= pie*(r**2))

[16/08/23, 8:21:19 PM] ~ Karthik Krishna: Initially if radius is r. Later newr is 0.83r. Change in area is pi*(r2-0.83r2) /pi*r2*100 which is 31.11 percent.

[16/08/23, 8:21:50 PM] ThiyagaB: also understand, the question is  **how much % area will be diminished?**
[16/08/23, 8:22:45 PM] ~ Naren: Radius decreases by 17% so the radius now is r-17r/100.
 Percentage of Area diminished = change in area / original area ×100
Change in area = πr² -πr²(1-17/100)²
So the percentage change is = 1-(83/100)²
=( 10000-6889)/10000×100
=31.11%

A Quick Overview on this week's DSA session:

Sunday 11:15 AM

1. Intro about Data structures and different types with real time examples
2. Intro into algorithms and its properties. 

DSA is a vast subject and we cannot cover in single session,  so the objective of the first class it to make this subject interesting with some fun.  
Based on the feedback, we will schedule few more sessions to cover all the DSA topics as per your syllabus.
For future sessions, we will try to restrict to limited seats.

[18/08/23, 8:14:23 PM] ThiyagaB: Problem: In a 20-story building, three elevators are operating simultaneously. Elevator A can carry up to 15 people, elevator B can carry up to 12 people, and elevator C can carry up to 10 people. If there are currently 35 people waiting to use the elevators on the ground floor, all the lifts are in ground floor and they all want to reach different floors within the building, what's the minimum number of trips required to transport all of them to their respective floors?
[18/08/23, 8:15:23 PM] Koushik PEC: 1 for each elevator
[18/08/23, 8:16:06 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: 3 trips -> first elevator can carry 15 ,second can carry 12 third can carry 8 so totally each one do one trip for carry people to their respective floors ‎<This message was edited>

*What is one engineering Marvel you wish didn't exist and why?* 

( for e.g you don’t wish smartphones to exist, bcuz we would have made more real connections ) 

It can be funny, crazy, thought provoking, philosophical… so don’t limit your thoughts :) ‎<This message was edited>

[19/08/23, 8:18:07 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: So personally I don't like this kindle thingy or reading books online because I prefer reading physical books that we could touch and feel, turn the pages 
Though online books are convenient and can make us read variety of books but books which has the cover page and the softness of the pages eh thani feel
Buying books from local bookshops than amazon is bestt
[19/08/23, 8:18:08 PM] ~ kowsiks: The evolution of e-books. Eventhough e-books are useful to us, the students are distructed by some ads which are present. During the pandemic situation, everyone are addicted to phone . More time is wasted and also it leads to some serious health issues like headpain,eyepwin,etc.
In my view if e-books are not discovered, students search book in such a way that the knowledge will retain to them forever, now everyone are lethargic that everything is available in internet. People are not interested in gaining knowledge.
[19/08/23, 8:19:21 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: If socialmedia like instagram were not discovered, many of them wont get addiction and we can get out of spending more time with gadgets . Bez of high usage of gadgets, we get many health issues which includes eye sight, mental happiness . 
This is only in my point of view. I know that Instagram has both positive and negative
[19/08/23, 8:19:31 PM] ~ Adithya🖤: I wish polyethylene bags weren't invented so that all would have used alternate to it like cotton bags/bio-degradable bags which could have brought a major change on our environment.

1) Time wasting as people are addicted
2) A study featured in the journal Behaviour & Information Technology reveals that passive social media use, which involves scrolling through others' content without actively posting, can lead users to experience feelings of *loneliness, stress, and depression.*
3) People are not actively communicating with friends and families as people are doing multi-tasking( on side watching reels, other side speaking with families in phone/studying) ‎<This message was edited>
[19/08/23, 8:21:07 PM] ~ SRI DHARANI: If mobile phones are not here we don't need to answer this question 😂 and it also reduces the negative effects of mobile phones on the younger generation.

[19/08/23, 8:25:23 PM] ~ Balamurugan S: For me it is the advancement of Deepfake Technology.

It easily allows people to disguise themselves as others, like famous celebrities ,leaders and influencers and it is so hard to distinguish between the real ones and the fake ones.

By posting videos using this technology on social media, it really misleads people, makes people embrace whatever the fact that has been told...
[19/08/23, 8:25:35 PM] ~ 👑: 😂😂😂.... Thaaatha paati kaalam mari irunthurukkalam 😂
[19/08/23, 8:27:35 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: The yt shorts and tiktok and insta reels are techs that are not necessities instead they are just value added features of these platforms which have become a necessity for people nowadays. I find it extremely time consuming and people would be well off and smart if these weren't invented as we would have spent our time in learning something new.
[19/08/23, 8:28:26 PM] ThiyagaB: Very good bala
[19/08/23, 8:28:53 PM] ThiyagaB: Epdi time odudhune therla
[19/08/23, 8:29:09 PM] ThiyagaB: Engada unna aala kaanume nu parthen…
[19/08/23, 8:29:11 PM] ~ Santhosh: Net um sir
[19/08/23, 8:29:23 PM] ~ Balamurugan S: Thank you sir 🙏
[19/08/23, 8:29:29 PM] Koushik PEC: Veliya irruken sir😂
[19/08/23, 8:32:02 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: I wish long distance travelling vehicles like Flights, Ships, Buses were not invented so that we can search for jobs in our locality and stay with our families happily. Also we can improve job opportunities in our locality which will lead to the development of our small towns.
[19/08/23, 8:33:17 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: In my point of view the worst invention in the history is the atomic bomb. But what if it might not had been invented. We might not have nuclear energy, nuclear medicine, or computers, some of which were originally built for nuclear weapons research. Our cars, airplanes, buildings, and bridges might be less safe because a lot of materials are inspected using nuclear materials (X-rays). Our food supply might be less reliable because we use gamma rays to sterilize many foods. The Mars rover Curiosity would not be zapping rocks on Mars without its plutonium power source. The spacecraft New Horizons visited Pluto last summer and the two Voyager spacecraft that are leaving the solar system are still communicating with us because of the same sources of power. The smoke detectors in your house depend on a man-made nuclear element called americium. We might not know that protons and neutrons are made of quarks, and my friend Murray Gell-Mann would not have gotten his Nobel Prize for figuring that out. We might not have discovered the Higgs Boson particle, and who knows how important that might turn out to be.

It is fun to think about. Certainly the history of nuclear weapons has not all been good, but as with anything that is complicated, good comes with bad, and bad comes with good. When we are lucky, the good eventually outweighs the bad.
[19/08/23, 8:33:21 PM] ~ Santhosh: If long distance travelling doesn't exist
Transportation of goods is not possible
Then how the development is possible?
[19/08/23, 8:33:57 PM] ~ Mano Ranjitham 💛: Money making machine...
Bcz money is making the peoples bad😿 .
If money making machine doesn't exist ,the goods for goods( exchanging )system will be continued ...So everyone will get the things they need& connection of peoples may also get increased..
[19/08/23, 8:34:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Interesting… ennenavo yosikireenga 👌
[19/08/23, 8:34:16 PM] ~ Ram: Weapons like atom bombs and guns cos namkitta intha maari oru superpower irukkungra reason thaan pala samayam war rise aaga reason even though they can be solved through peace conferences. The starting point for creation of bombs and guns  itself is the race to defeat others. At first it was started as an advancement of science to protect us but now they are the major reason for a massive destruction. Many scientists like Einstein, Maxim and Oppenheimer who were the key reason for the foundation of Bombs and guns have also regretted for this reason. I think what they believed became true, the destruction.
[19/08/23, 8:34:28 PM] ThiyagaB: Development eh venam solran
[19/08/23, 8:35:13 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Plz read fully.So any invention has good and bad , and we can't say one thing is bad and another one is good.As an engineering student I can proudly say Engineering is always ultimate. ‎<This message was edited>
[19/08/23, 8:35:31 PM] ThiyagaB: I have one topic about finance  for students, if we get a chance we can talk abt this
[19/08/23, 8:37:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Nanda , you come up with detailed interesting point always… 👏👏
[19/08/23, 8:39:33 PM] ThiyagaB: Yesss… for each of the point here we can counter argue, but right now i just want to listen to your thought process.. no judgement, no counter argument.. 

We will have one debate session another weekend
[19/08/23, 8:40:23 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Sure sir.
[19/08/23, 8:42:39 PM] ThiyagaB: Seeing all your different unique views, oru healthy debate vecha fire ah irukum nenaikiren,
[19/08/23, 8:44:39 PM] ~ Mohamed Imran: That's just my point of view
[19/08/23, 8:47:52 PM] ~ Ram: Watches even though it is the best way for time management and other things I always think watches vanthuthulenthu naama rombha restrictivea maaritomonu thonudhu. We try to limit ourselves from all the activities of day-to-day life and oru rushup life maari namakku feel aaguthu. Oru chinna vishayatha kooda time illanu naama enjoy pannama vitturom. I think we have struck on a 9-5 loop of life. This may sound weird but it's just my pov.
[19/08/23, 8:49:14 PM] ThiyagaB: Dei nee Vera level… i always thought about this… 
We are always time bounded, a world where we don’t think of time and do things in our own speed porumaya enjoy panni
[19/08/23, 8:52:05 PM] ~ Sri Rama Pandian H U 😇😎😉😊: Government rule was the worst idea ever created by human.In the name of democracy they r cheating us.The worst thing in human evolution is government
[19/08/23, 8:52:20 PM] ~ Ram: Thanks a lot
[19/08/23, 8:52:51 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro then what is the alternative.
[19/08/23, 8:54:38 PM] Koushik PEC: It is just fine if worked  how it should actually work ‎<This message was edited>
[19/08/23, 8:55:49 PM] ~ Ram: Rules aren't the worst idea the ideas which were created to break the rules are the worst one
[19/08/23, 8:56:03 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: 😂didn't expect that sir
[19/08/23, 8:57:16 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro I think he didn't mean rules , he here argue about democratic rule.
[19/08/23, 8:57:40 PM] ~ Ram: Ok
[19/08/23, 9:09:03 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Smart watches 
One of the most overrated things to exist in tech
There is  no  worthful innovation in it.
If we need to see time ,we have analog ,digital watches or mobile phones.
Yeah , it does have like measuring heartbeat , step counter. But are those really necessary?
But much time we r gonna save by using it instead of  using the real devices which can do the work!
[19/08/23, 9:14:25 PM] ThiyagaB: hahah. adhu oru gethu ku..  apple smartwatch scene podlam :)
[19/08/23, 9:15:12 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Ministers laam kuda vachikanga sir
[19/08/23, 9:15:34 PM] ~ Thirumurugan A: https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-watch-saves-life-of-a-36-year-old-user-suffering-from-heart-condition-2345300-2023-03-11
[19/08/23, 9:18:27 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: Nobody is speaking about video games and mobile games
Like pubg , free fire. I also argue abt this discovery because it also provoke violence mentality among man kind especially teenagers sir
Many of them are affected mentally by these games
If these were not discovered 
We will play outdoors
In indoors, we can play our traditional games
They are meant to improve our knowledge,Personality development too..
[19/08/23, 9:21:24 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Video games doesn't mean only pubg or free fire .
Video games are just a separate world.
They are same as movies.
Our favourite stars movies  violence, same usage of drugs scene yet fans and audience enjoy them.
Gamers enjoy and live in a beautiful world.
As a fellow gamer, it is sad to see many still have this pov on video games.
[19/08/23, 9:22:08 PM] Koushik PEC: Actually video games doesn't only mean battle royales there are good video game which goes along with a story for me personally those fills the gap of me not watching movies
[19/08/23, 9:22:34 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: I am only taking abt video games which spread violence thought
[19/08/23, 9:22:52 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: I am not taking abt games like chess😅
[19/08/23, 9:23:25 PM] ~ Thyagu: I would say that convincing people that converting to  electric vehicles results in a cleaner environment. I can't deny the fact that ev results in fewer carbon emissions than gasoline-burning cars under any circumstances,  but only if the lifetime of the ev is long. Or else the production of those batteries alone will fill up the carbon emissions reduced by ev. I would say that hydrogen powered cars are a much better alternative
[19/08/23, 9:23:34 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: A game having violence means doesn't mean it is a bad thing
Like movie censor there is a separate censor board we should take notice of it and enjoy them
[19/08/23, 9:24:40 PM] Koushik PEC: Actually I didn't mean chess it is a common misconception that video games only contain violence u'll understand only if u experience it :)
[19/08/23, 9:27:51 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Like, some tv shows like big boss , most of the adults are addicted and affected by candidates fights.
[19/08/23, 9:29:18 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro but online games includes rummy and other bidding games. It spoils many people's life. Some games  promote gambling though . It results in decreased mental and physical.
[19/08/23, 9:30:24 PM] Koushik PEC: Those are just scams and actually spoiling the reputation of gaming industry
[19/08/23, 9:32:47 PM] ~ Sree: Handmade designs made by carpenters on doors , designs made by painters on building , carvings made by sculptor is always unique and mesmerizing !!! Due to arrival of machines like CNC router , people have started shifting to those kind of design implementation. Practically, it is less time consuming and cost effective but the employment and work skills of these artists are reducing drastically.
[19/08/23, 9:36:20 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro many people addicted to the video games . It spoils many children's life . It diverts their path towards such silly games. You guys still  stand with those games.
[19/08/23, 9:39:09 PM] ~ 💞: ‎~ 💞 left
[19/08/23, 9:38:29 PM] Koushik PEC: Its true in India bro but most of the games here I meant are story games
[19/08/23, 9:39:51 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Are story games give you anything good.
[19/08/23, 9:40:23 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: How does many movies give us valuable messages?
[19/08/23, 9:40:33 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Same like that games also would give us valuable messages
[19/08/23, 9:40:41 PM] Koushik PEC: For simple understanding story games are like movies which has an end and the memories created will be along with us for rest of our life but battle royales are like serials which never ends and gets people addicted to it
[19/08/23, 9:40:45 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: I basically need to mention the idea of traditional games
Which have many physiological and physical healthiness
[19/08/23, 9:41:33 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: Which were taken by few mobile games
[19/08/23, 9:42:35 PM] Koushik PEC: Haha I mean people getting adicted to story games are least common as they end after a playtime
[19/08/23, 9:43:52 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: People can't just blame all video games in place of few battle royales!
Games provide gamers many memories
[19/08/23, 9:44:22 PM] Koushik PEC: Literally 30% of my overall knowledge bro let's take a game called Assassin's creed which thought me more history than any history class did
[19/08/23, 9:45:36 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Video games are just another hobby for most people. We pursue some things that let's us take a break from real life - it can be watching dumb rom-coms, picking up science fiction novels and playing video games. Is it a waste of time? Then that would go for all other means of media that aren't productive.

I myself read books and play video games on most of my free time. On days where I don't feel like spending a whole day hooked to a book, I could just hop in and out of video games.

[19/08/23, 9:46:51 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Do books like 1984 and Cathcher in the rye do you any good? They are just stories but they open out mind to new thoughts and processes
[19/08/23, 9:47:03 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Yes sir
[19/08/23, 9:47:29 PM] ThiyagaB: ivlo supera pesuriye..    why were u silent so far :) ?
[19/08/23, 9:48:02 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro few years ago we could saw many children playing in the streets peacefully . It increases their physical and mental health . But online games make paralysed in our places.
[19/08/23, 9:48:27 PM] Koushik PEC: He was waiting for the topic to change to video games i guess
[19/08/23, 9:48:41 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Discussion nadakura time-la naa online-la iruka maatinguren sir and it felt awkward to join after it's over. Today was a weekend so 🙂
[19/08/23, 9:50:07 PM] Koushik PEC: I can actually see children play outside daily bro
[19/08/23, 9:50:24 PM] ThiyagaB: and a perfect topic for you to enter ? :)   But your thoughts and vocabulary are very clear..      Keep it up..
[19/08/23, 9:50:25 PM] Koushik PEC: I am not sure abt other areas
[19/08/23, 9:50:26 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: That's a valid point but I still see people play in the streets. Hostelers here go out to play cricket in the ground every weekend even though they have unrestricted access to video games
[19/08/23, 9:50:48 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Thank you sir
[19/08/23, 9:50:53 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: I saw some people saying that their biggest goal is to finishing the atmost level in such games.
[19/08/23, 9:51:21 PM] Koushik PEC: Yeah those are the battle royales I was talking abt
[19/08/23, 9:52:49 PM] ‪+91 74185 51375‬: ‎‪+91 74185 51375‬ left
[19/08/23, 9:52:04 PM] Koushik PEC: In story games u can't actually do that as there is no certain lvl or something:)
[19/08/23, 9:52:13 PM] ~ Shakith. A: Online games maybe addictive ah irukalam bro ana neenga story games adirukingala like movies la nama act panra feel and andha experience epome marakathu and indha maari story games la story finish panita avolodha levels, competition idhellam irukathu
[19/08/23, 9:53:07 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Your point is valid, Video game addiction is a thing. But can you really blame a child who grew up in an urban household/ apartments. As I said there is a lot of factors that lead to video game addiction
[19/08/23, 9:53:49 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Addiction happens when they don't get enough of what they need in really life and it leads to such things.
[19/08/23, 9:54:42 PM] ~ Arun: Some people spend money to buy skins, coins etc...
[19/08/23, 9:54:58 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Also video games are not just story games and battle royale .
There is a lot of variety of genres in it.
Each person has a different taste.
To every different taste , they are different games.
[19/08/23, 9:55:07 PM] Koushik PEC: Again BATTLE ROYALES
[19/08/23, 9:55:28 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: Anna’s
My only ques is 
Can u leave those games for 2 months and engage with others
Then it better to play games in leisure time
[19/08/23, 9:55:40 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: That comes under the whole microtransactions thing
[19/08/23, 9:56:29 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: I did? I barely play video games during college days cause I don't get time for it amidst classes, socializing (which happens a lot in college)
[19/08/23, 9:56:34 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: To play a game , people don't really need microtransactions in life- service games!
[19/08/23, 9:57:01 PM] Koushik PEC: To be honest I play like 3hr per week
[19/08/23, 9:57:13 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Make sure one point how many percentage of people playing story games and how many percentage of that playing battle royal games .
[19/08/23, 9:57:14 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Bro people playing battle royal games more.
[19/08/23, 9:57:52 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: Anna
If u are u asked to leave games for a months
Is it possible? 
This is my only ques ‎<This message was edited>
[19/08/23, 9:57:54 PM] Koushik PEC: U kinda get bored when u enter adulthood
[19/08/23, 9:58:10 PM] ~ Ahalya VS: I hereby dont want to criticise story games
[19/08/23, 9:58:14 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: The point is not only about you bro ,don't you ever saw anyone playing games a lot of hours in a day?
[19/08/23, 9:58:52 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Bro Just people playing more battle royale means video games aren't bad
[19/08/23, 9:58:56 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Microtransaction means transaction in small scale right?
[19/08/23, 9:58:58 PM] Koushik PEC: Not only games bro overdoing any thing becomes bad even studies
[19/08/23, 9:59:58 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Yeah, like those games selling small things for a small price. People can lose track of themselves and spend crazy. It's just an unfortunate state of industry which should not be happening
[19/08/23, 10:00:14 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: But it does, because it makes the most money for the top corporations
[19/08/23, 10:00:28 PM] ~ Arun: I see people spending thousands of money in that
[19/08/23, 10:00:38 PM] Koushik PEC: It's true but as a game dev how do I make money:)
[19/08/23, 10:01:19 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Exaclty and it's not gonna stop unless we educate people on spending habits. Cause the governments can't really stop the corporations from doing it
[19/08/23, 10:01:46 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: By selling the game or releasing the game as free and selling in game items.
That's how the gaming industry works!
[19/08/23, 10:01:58 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: I hereby criticising the game which affects the people. And if you guys still stands with kinda silly games is just an utter non sense. I just mention those gambling games.
[19/08/23, 10:01:59 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Make an bestseller indie title like undertale for $5 and get a cult following 🤣
[19/08/23, 10:03:05 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: One man's trash is another man's treasure I guess. I see value in good video games, I stand by it. you don't. We don't need to attack each other with words calling it as non sense
[19/08/23, 10:03:51 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: They are not just kinda silly games ,
And we are not standing with those so-called video games.  I mean gambling games

[19/08/23, 10:09:58 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Blame the goverment I guess 😶

[19/08/23, 10:23:22 PM] ~ Arun: Many people don't support such gambling games unless they think they can earn money through that(and they recommend us to play)
[19/08/23, 10:28:32 PM] ThiyagaB: oru conclusion pottu mudippom pa debate :) 

If Game is only viewed as form of entertainment which deserves its own defined time.. its always good.. Whats life without an entertainment..
and also its a billion dollar business,  we cant avoid it. 

But one thing i personally missed to do in your age is to be involved in lots of real sports, as you are getting older that makes a huge difference..   So wherever possible.. real games um vidadheenga..
[19/08/23, 10:30:37 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw asusual a day b4 exams padikira maadhiri...  innaiku night out pottu dhan namma session ku prepare eh seiyanum..   So signing off..   

Sleep well every one..  Naalaiku alarm vechu 11 ku vandhu serunga ellarum..

[21/08/23, 8:23:22 PM] ThiyagaB: Good evening ppl
I hope for all of you semester exams are over
[21/08/23, 8:33:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Today’s quiz on economy.

1$ = 83₹ 

But that doesn’t mean one milk packet sells for 0.25$ 
Or any item sells in US in the same ratio as India. 

So how is this defined? 

you can Google too.
Anyone aspiring to foreign nations, this definition really helps
[21/08/23, 8:34:09 PM] ~ Santhosh: This relates to purchasing power parity
[21/08/23, 8:34:47 PM] ~ Santhosh: Each nation has different purchasing power parity...
Which determines the product's price
[21/08/23, 8:36:45 PM] ThiyagaB: More details
[21/08/23, 8:36:46 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Each goods have its own demand and market availability in their own countries. So ya, I agree
[21/08/23, 8:37:00 PM] ~ Arun: Sir started today
[21/08/23, 8:38:21 PM] ~ ^_^: It depends on the supply and demand chain Sir..
[21/08/23, 8:38:22 PM] Koushik PEC: That depends on inflation, taxes based on other countries etc
[21/08/23, 8:38:40 PM] ~ ^_^: Something which is expensive here might be cheap in foreign countries
[21/08/23, 8:38:42 PM] ~ Purushothaman Srinivasan: Exchange rates tell us how much one currency is worth compared to another. But the prices of things in different countries don't always match the exchange rate exactly. Dis is cuz prices are influenced by many things, like how much it costs to make something, what people are willing to pay, and the local economy.
[21/08/23, 8:40:59 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: It also depends on the IMPORT/EXPORT & ECONOMIC POLICY of the country.
[21/08/23, 8:43:27 PM] ~ Santhosh: The product like milk are mostly indigenous and available in more quantity
So taxes for those products are less, price of  product is less
Whereas the imported(to india) products/things have heavier taxes so price increases compared to the origin country
[21/08/23, 8:44:22 PM] ~ KATHIRESAN T: The rates or different from one country to another country is depends on 
1.stock exchanges ,
2.exchanges in index,
3.mutual funds,
4.financial data.
[21/08/23, 8:46:38 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Fossil Fuels could be good examples, they are imported with heavy duty charges from Gulf Countries
[21/08/23, 8:46:45 PM] ~ Mano Ranjitham 💛: It is based on the purchasing power parity(PPP). 

It depends on the inflation,supply and demand,political stability and Economic performance,interest rate.
[21/08/23, 8:46:53 PM] ~ Arun: The rates of products are different due to some of the factors
 The taxes, production rate, country demand, export & import of goods, countries economy
[21/08/23, 8:52:24 PM] ~ Karan: It depends on import and export , tax , supply and demand chain.
[21/08/23, 8:59:50 PM] ~ ^_^: Directly or indirectly this is one of the most important criteria
[21/08/23, 9:01:14 PM] Koushik PEC: Y no one talks about inflation in different countries differ
[21/08/23, 9:01:43 PM] Koushik PEC: Inflation doesn't do the same in every region
[21/08/23, 9:02:27 PM] ~ 💞: ‎~ 💞 left
[21/08/23, 9:02:32 PM] ~ ^_^: The inflation rate stays stable most of the time
[21/08/23, 9:05:03 PM] ~ ^_^: I'm connecting it with each country's own inflation rate...
[21/08/23, 9:05:05 PM] ~ ^_^: Not comparing
[21/08/23, 9:05:41 PM] Koushik PEC: The question compares India and us
[21/08/23, 9:05:50 PM] Koushik PEC: Not India to India
[21/08/23, 9:05:57 PM] Koushik PEC: :)
[21/08/23, 9:12:54 PM] ~ ^_^: In other countries it's calculated in a different way bro
[21/08/23, 9:13:19 PM] ~ ^_^: Again it clings to the supply and demand chain
[21/08/23, 9:14:31 PM] Koushik PEC: It is just difference in CPI in percentage bro
[21/08/23, 9:14:41 PM] Koushik PEC: How can it different
[21/08/23, 9:16:10 PM] Koushik PEC: But inflation is still calculated the same
[21/08/23, 9:16:34 PM] Koushik PEC: Cam someone elaborate??
[21/08/23, 9:16:59 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: The main reason for difference in prices is the PPP.One of the primary reasons for differences in PPP between countries is differences in average incomesIndia has a lower per capita income compared to the United States, which means that the prices of goods and services in India are generally lower. Inflation can also affect the PPP calculation, as it can lead to changes in the cost of living in different countries. As per 2021 1dollar - 23 rupees apprx.
[21/08/23, 9:29:33 PM] ThiyagaB: Sorry guys couldn’t follow up.. but good answers.. 

Purchase power parity includes everything including inflation, demand, supply etc.. 

More than the exchange rate, this ppp gives a fair idea what salary you can expect and how much you can save if you move to a new country

[22/08/23, 8:21:15 PM] Product Manager: Hi All, 

I'm guessing all of you must be familiar with Chatgpt. This LLM model runs nearly 10million queries everyday. And it costs around $700000 a day, they're said to go bankrupt by 2024.

How do you think they will sustain?
[22/08/23, 8:21:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Rightu opening question eh, billion dollar question ah.. 
let’s see
[22/08/23, 8:23:10 PM] ThiyagaB: Open ended questions are tough to reward, irundhalum will c today who gives interesting answer
[22/08/23, 8:24:06 PM] ThiyagaB: Periya DONATION page open pannidlama 🤔 
Jk
[22/08/23, 8:25:11 PM] Koushik PEC: Am just afraid of gpt restricting the free api access 😅
[22/08/23, 8:26:16 PM] ThiyagaB: They will soon.. 
so ppl just give you crazy thoughts
[22/08/23, 8:27:56 PM] Koushik PEC: Probably they should come up with another powerful model like gpt4.5 or something and open source gpt 4 so more people start hosting gpt 4 which can be utilised by many people
[22/08/23, 8:28:25 PM] ~ ^_^: They are actually working on it...on how to reduce the cost...most probably they might be adding different AI tools for ChatGPT
[22/08/23, 8:28:52 PM] ~ ^_^: It will mostly be paid...so they get some revenue from it
[22/08/23, 8:31:50 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Chatgpt generates revenue through sponsored content and partnerships with businesses and organizations. 

For instance, ChatGPT may partner with a business to develop a language processing solution for a specific use case and, in return, receive compensation for the partnership.  

Advertising is another way ChatGPT makes money. By displaying ads on its website or social media channels, ChatGPT can generate revenue from businesses that want to reach its audience.Finally, ChatGPT may generate revenue through data monetization.
 They may also provide another version of gpt and can generate income through subscription amount.
[22/08/23, 8:33:43 PM] ~ Sivanipriya🦋: I think they are now giving free access  just to train it but soon only paid users only can access it.
[22/08/23, 8:33:55 PM] Koushik PEC: There is another version of gpt which costs 20$ :)
[22/08/23, 8:48:42 PM] ThiyagaB: Idhu panna epdi revenue varum
[22/08/23, 8:50:17 PM] Koushik PEC: Revenue illa sir cost kammi pannum
[22/08/23, 8:50:43 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Currently, GPT 3.5 is free. However, anybody who wants to integrate an AI-driven feature that's actually useful and more than just a gimmick will need the higher tiers (4 and I believe development of 5 has been paused due to the security problems with the development of AI this powerful).

So it's a win-win, people get to have a taste of the AI future for free and if they have to wield it, they need to pay up.
[22/08/23, 8:52:17 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: They can't do it anytime soon, they are already in a race against bard and llama
[22/08/23, 8:53:09 PM] Product Manager: All you guys are pointing out the facts, my question is how will they sustain
[22/08/23, 8:54:17 PM] Product Manager: We all know they have a subscription plan, they're planning to expand it, they have advertisement partnerships
[22/08/23, 8:55:00 PM] Product Manager: But the number of free users will increase faster than the subscribed users
[22/08/23, 8:55:37 PM] Product Manager: As pointed out by @917418585920 they've competitors
[22/08/23, 8:57:11 PM] Product Manager: And also it's a classic push market technique, once we're accustomed to the seamlessness, we'll feel forced to pay for it
[22/08/23, 8:57:43 PM] ~ ^_^: How does bard cost less than ChatGPT?
[22/08/23, 8:57:48 PM] Koushik PEC: Gpt should also start giving out completely free gpt3.5 to compete with them as llama is  completely open sourced
[22/08/23, 8:58:17 PM] Koushik PEC: Bro bard is free bro
[22/08/23, 8:58:32 PM] Vinith Walmart: Dhyudshsgehe
[22/08/23, 8:58:34 PM] ThiyagaB: I guess even the subscription and the current source of revenue is not enough to sustain
[22/08/23, 8:58:47 PM] ThiyagaB: That’s why they are calling it might bankrupt soon
[22/08/23, 8:58:46 PM] Koushik PEC: Gpt just gives us 5$ free credit
[22/08/23, 8:58:47 PM] ~ ^_^: I'm saying abt the cost they have to maintain it
[22/08/23, 8:58:48 PM] Vinith Walmart: Zxfdhdduososyst👍🏻🏃🏻‍♂️
[22/08/23, 8:59:14 PM] ThiyagaB: Vinith always comes with unique ideas , adhukaga idhu romba overa irukke 🤔

[22/08/23, 9:00:41 PM] Product Manager: Bro decided to Google "How does Chatgpt generate revenue" and post the first answer that pops up😭😂
[22/08/23, 9:01:36 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: 🤣
[22/08/23, 9:02:02 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Yeah but with some changes.
[22/08/23, 9:02:07 PM] ThiyagaB: Nanda is very straight forward, direct a chatgpt kittaye ketrupan, how are you surviving nu
[22/08/23, 9:04:50 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Just my guess - right now a lot of companies are trying to integrate AI into their business (some do it forcefully like Snapchat AI I have no idea why it exists). 

Soon there will be a real use case for AI which will lend them a competitive edge in the market. Until then it's just a race between the AI companies to keep themselves as the most powerful AI in the market so that all the watchful eyes will be on them. And chatgpt will be able to sustain for that long as Microsoft is willing to back then up to prevent Google from winning the race.

Just speculation here.
[22/08/23, 9:05:44 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: When that happens every company will have to integrate AI somehow into their products and services
[22/08/23, 9:05:50 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: And that's a lot of money in the oven
[22/08/23, 9:05:52 PM] ThiyagaB: Good point, and certainly that’s the major one as of now, the investments from bigger companies to be in the race
[22/08/23, 9:06:11 PM] ThiyagaB: I asked you already, do you write blog?
[22/08/23, 9:06:26 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: No sir
[22/08/23, 9:06:53 PM] ThiyagaB: Any place where i could see you writing other than here? Like posts, article anything?
[22/08/23, 9:07:38 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Japan Karan ennenamo kandupudikiran ...
[22/08/23, 9:07:50 PM] ThiyagaB: Hahaha that same moment
[22/08/23, 9:07:52 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: I haven't written anything publicly so far sir
[22/08/23, 9:08:43 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok unna mind la vechiruken, will c if we find right opportunity
[22/08/23, 9:08:54 PM] Vinith Walmart: Ada pavingala... I didn't even notice this ping... Ivala sambhavam nadanthurcha sirapu...
[22/08/23, 9:08:58 PM] SHIVABALAN MANI🦂: OpenAI seems to be heading towards a model where advanced features are exclusively available to subscribed users, a strategy that could substantially enhance their financial sustainability! Speculations regarding potential bankruptcy by 2024 might not happen because of the backing that OpenAI is currently receiving from numerous companies. Recently Microsoft has invested 10 billion USD into it! In case of the worst situation, Big companies may come forward to buy chatgpt and try to make a profit out of it! To avoid such situations, they should develop different platforms that support users from different industries, to grab the attention of free users so that their user count will increase, and even if one platform fails another one will compensate it!
[22/08/23, 9:09:30 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Yes sir, glad to hear I caught the attention 😌
[22/08/23, 9:09:41 PM] ~ ^_^: 👀
[22/08/23, 9:10:49 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes so far the main summary is, 

Even with current subscription model it will bankrupt, 

So Microsoft backup only way,
idha thavira any major thought?

[22/08/23, 9:12:41 PM] Koushik PEC: What if:

Plot twist eh chatgpt sold to Google after bankruptcy
[22/08/23, 9:13:06 PM] ThiyagaB: Microsoft will never let that happen
[22/08/23, 9:14:12 PM] ~ ^_^: What if:

Elon Enters the Chat
[22/08/23, 9:14:42 PM] Product Manager: Agree with your point, Snap AI is like a personal assistant that gives underdeveloped friendship and relationship advice. Since AI seems to be the Trend people are trying to employ it in all the gaps possible
[22/08/23, 9:15:09 PM] ThiyagaB: He is in already, hope you know elon was once an investor in openai
[22/08/23, 9:15:50 PM] Product Manager: Dude😭😂 no one in my office kooda ivlo professionally articulated answer thara maataanga
[22/08/23, 9:17:13 PM] ThiyagaB: Since i asked ppl to look at business angle you all only seeing from a business perspective, 
But core la naama la still engineers la, is there any engineering ways to achieve this?
[22/08/23, 9:19:21 PM] Product Manager: I was also kind of hoping for some technical answers, but everyone's focused on the revenue rather than the process
[22/08/23, 9:19:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Pasanga business ppl aagitanga
[22/08/23, 9:21:20 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: With the user data, chatgpt can analyse trends and provide valuable insights and predictions using data analytics methods and this will be used by small and medium scale businesses which accounts for some revenue. In the future, some other large scale companies may also follow this and replace their existing data analytics staff and staffs from other sectors and thereby it will generate a considerable amount of revenue for chatgpt. Subscription version accounts for some revenue.
Microsoft invests heavily in research and development to enhance the advanced natural language processing algorithms of these chatbots. These enable GPT to understand and interpret human language, context, and emotions to create personalized responses. Microsoft leverages its massive customer base and partnerships with other businesses to market and promote its chatbot services. They offer their chatbot solutions as part of their cloud-based services, such as Microsoft Azure. This provides businesses with a platform to integrate chatbots into their operations quickly and efficiently and to generate revenue from them.Microsoft also generates revenue by partnering with businesses to create customize chatgpt to their specific needs, such as customer service, sales, and marketing. These customized chatbots can be used to improve business efficiency, customer engagement, and generate leads and revenue.
In summary, Microsoft has used considerable investment in research, broad customer base, and partnership with corporations to enhance and promote chatbot services, generating substantial revenue from subscription fees, premium features, and custom chatbot creation and thus stands at the top of the market. As long as this process continues, chatgpt will survive and lead the market.
[22/08/23, 9:22:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Nice new entry? And first post?

[22/08/23, 9:36:01 PM] ThiyagaB: Adhellam already started to happen :)
[22/08/23, 9:36:58 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: True Caller, Uber, Meta ect.. already gone through this and lot of data has been stolen sir, but these AI shouldn't posses those threats
[22/08/23, 9:38:00 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Coz, those companies just know our call history or location data
But these AI will be knowing everything about us, health,financial ect..
[22/08/23, 9:38:11 PM] ThiyagaB: It’s hard, for sure that’s the toughest one to crack to create a ethical, safe AI. 
This itself is one big branch.. may be when you guys finish your engineering this role will be in huge demand
[22/08/23, 9:38:40 PM] ThiyagaB: Now a days, every other hollywood movie is based on this dhan la

[23/08/23, 8:01:20 PM] ThiyagaB: Good Evening ppl, 
Today is a pride moment for our nation as we are the first country to land in South pole..
Also i am proud that one of my class mate from CEG is part of those scientists
[23/08/23, 8:03:56 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Goosebumps sir
[23/08/23, 8:04:23 PM] ThiyagaB: Yes really
[23/08/23, 8:07:32 PM] ThiyagaB: So shall we have a quiz related to this, 
There is a concept called hohmann transfer orbit which is used for these space travel.

The quiz is related to that, you can google, and it’s a bit tough unless you google and understand..
[23/08/23, 8:10:21 PM] ThiyagaB: A space agency is planning to send a satellite from Earth to the Moon using a Hohmann transfer orbit. The details are as follows:

The distance from the Earth's surface to the satellite's initial orbit is 300 km.
The average distance from the Earth's surface to the Moon is 384,100 km.
The Hohmann transfer orbit is an elliptical path. One end (closest point to Earth) starts at the satellite's initial orbit, and the other end (farthest point from Earth) touches the Moon's orbit.

Calculate:

a) The distance from Earth's center to the satellite's initial orbit.
b) The distance from Earth's center to the Moon.
c) The average distance (or semi-major axis) of the Hohmann transfer orbit.
[23/08/23, 8:10:50 PM] ThiyagaB: Try it out, we have a reward today if we get right explanation and answer
[23/08/23, 8:12:16 PM] Koushik PEC: A) 6,371 + 300 =6,671km
[23/08/23, 8:12:38 PM] Koushik PEC: Radius of earth 6371
[23/08/23, 8:13:45 PM] Koushik PEC: B) 384100 + 6371is 390471
[23/08/23, 8:17:01 PM] Koushik PEC: c) 192,200.5 km
[23/08/23, 8:17:21 PM] Koushik PEC: for c the calc --> (300 km + 384,100 km) / 2

[23/08/23, 8:17:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Romba tough a kettutomo, someone left the group kochittu
[23/08/23, 8:18:00 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: A) 6671 KM
B) to surface of the moon = 390471 KM
To centre of moon = 392,208.4 KM
C) the semi major axis of the ellipse connecting the initial and final orbit will be 385,537.4 KM
[23/08/23, 8:18:55 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Distance of the moon from earth is 384100 - satellite orbit + radius of the moon (since the orbit of the moon passes through it's centre)
[23/08/23, 8:19:20 PM] ~ Santhosh: A) 6371+300=6671km
B) 384100km
C) (300+384100)/2= 192200km
[23/08/23, 8:19:45 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: 384100 - 300 + 1737.4 give 385,537.4 KM
[23/08/23, 8:21:54 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Nevermind I am wrong 😶
[23/08/23, 8:23:36 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: C) 192,200 KM
[23/08/23, 8:26:52 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: a)6,371 km + 300 km = 6,671 km

b)384,100 km + 6,371 km = 390,471 km

c) The average distance (or semi-major axis) of the Hohmann transfer orbit can be calculated using the following formula:

a = (r1 + r2)/2 + (r2 - r1)/2 * sqrt(2)

Where:
a = semi-major axis
r1 = distance from Earth's center to the satellite's initial orbit
r2 = distance from Earth's center to the Moon

a = (6,671 km + 390,471 km)/2 + (390,471 km - 6,671 km)/2 * sqrt(2)
a = 198,571 km
[23/08/23, 8:31:19 PM] ThiyagaB: will wait for some more time..
[23/08/23, 8:32:37 PM] Koushik PEC: I mean u took r1 dist from the center but ofcourse Satellite is not gonna launch from the center right :)
[23/08/23, 8:33:47 PM] ThiyagaB: but the question asked is from the center
[23/08/23, 8:34:20 PM] ~ prasanth: A)The distance from earth center to Satellite initial orbit is 6671km because, {add earth radius and surface to orbit distance}
B)the distance from earth center to moon is 3,84,400
(By adding avg distance from earth surface to moon and dis from earth surface to satellite initial orbit i.e (3,84,100+300))
3)the avg distance of hohmann transfer orbit is 1,92,350km ‎<This message was edited>
[23/08/23, 8:35:46 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: Refer to the above diagram
[23/08/23, 8:41:54 PM] ~ prasanth: 3) 1,92,350 km
[23/08/23, 8:45:00 PM] ~ prasanth: C) by adding the radius of satellite initial orbit and earth center to moon orbit we can attain the average distance of hohmann transfer orbit i.e 1,92,350km

[25/08/23, 8:15:24 PM] ThiyagaB: Quiz: 

Two identical elevators start at the same floor of a building. One goes up 2 floors every minute, and the other goes up 3 floors every minute. If both elevators have started at the same time, will they ever be on the same floor again? Until it reaches the top If yes, when?
[25/08/23, 8:16:11 PM] ~ Santhosh: The multiples of 6
[25/08/23, 8:16:18 PM] ~ Dukatu: 6 th floor
[25/08/23, 8:16:58 PM] ~ Lakshmi Praba: Yes,They will meet after 6 minutes
[25/08/23, 8:17:01 PM] Koushik PEC: No, probably at the top most floor where it finally stops
[25/08/23, 8:17:16 PM] ~ Vaishu: Yes, they will be on the same floor again. Their least common multiple (LCM) in this case, the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. So, they will be on the same floor every 6 minutes.
[25/08/23, 8:17:55 PM] ~ Santhosh: Both the elevators will not be at the same time in meeting floors
But they might meet on floors with multiples of 6
[25/08/23, 8:18:44 PM] Koushik PEC: After sixth min one will be at 12th floor and another will be at 18th floor right?
[25/08/23, 8:18:50 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: No
[25/08/23, 8:19:10 PM] ~ Santhosh: If the top floor is less than 6
It wont meet again
So the common floor will be the starting floor only ‎<This message was edited>
[25/08/23, 8:19:35 PM] ~ S Divya Darsshini ✨😇: No.. They will never be on the same floor.. ‎<This message was edited>
[25/08/23, 8:20:49 PM] ~ ^_^: They will but in different timings
[25/08/23, 8:21:44 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: 1 min = one elevator at 2nd floor & second elevator at 3rd floor

2 min = one at 4th floor & second elevator at 6th floor

Both are increasing

Not possible to Meet again ‎<This message was edited>
[25/08/23, 8:22:45 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Not possible to meet again

Ok the mathematical answer is, 
"No they wont meet again"

But practical answer is,

They can meet in any floor, depends on how long ppl takes to get in and out
[25/08/23, 8:59:15 PM] ThiyagaB: the simple point is, one is faster than the other, so obviously they cant meet until the destination.
[25/08/23, 8:59:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Koushik, hari and Divya Darshini answered right today

[26/08/23, 8:05:43 PM] ThiyagaB: What’s the recent interesting game you played? 

It shouldn’t be the usual popular ones like PubG, clashe royale etc.. 

For example recently I played this “AntiChess” where the goal is to lose all the players first in the game.. it’s real fun , i suggest to try, it just lasts for 5 mins each two player game,

[26/08/23, 8:14:57 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Loop hero
[26/08/23, 8:16:59 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Loop hero has an interesting take on the concept of framing your own level. The game starts with an empty map and you get to drop places onto the map. Each place has it's own pros and cons and the more you add more rewards you get to reap - but it also leads to more chances of your hero getting kill.

You have to balance the risk and reward throughout the game and that's a very cool game pattern. I didn't complete it cause it got too repetitive but it's worth trying out for an hour ‎<This message was edited>

It is a period where plague was a huge deal and rats where one of the biggest problems. The story starts like when an perticular gang starts ambush the castle for some reason [spoilers] from there the game moves like sister protecting hey little brother from the gang which is hunting her brother for some reason [ the same spoiler] 

Overall the game is emotion filled with adventure of a protective sister ‎<This message was edited>

This game is the most awesome one I have played in years. 
Now u ask me why?
He are things you shd be aware to understand a gamer.
We care about: 
Story
Gameplay
Characterizations
Experience 
Involvement into those characters
Emotions
Intensity
Adventure and action
Challenges 
Graphics

This game has all the aspects of being an All rounder.
The story sets in a world where it is infested by Zombies and thugs. It gets started by showcasing main character *JOEL* who was just a father who loses his daughter during the phase of getting out of town.
This game is about rescuing a little girl named *ELLIE* by *JOEL*. Because she is IMMUNE to the virus. Hence a vaccine can be extracted out of her. Lot of struggles, lots of battle and lost many close people to reach the doctors. But the climax is what sets this whole to the different level and completely unexpected.
To know.. just don't play it.. experience it XD

Ultimate time passing game
It lasts forever
As level increasing , the time consumption to complete the level increases 
Best suggestion for lockdown
[26/08/23, 8:40:35 PM] ~ Fadhil: There is almost more than one way to pocket a ball, and having full control of the cue ball as well as knowing how to prep for the next or next couple of shots is the best way to win . Thinking atleast one step ahead mindset is to actually have a plannned route to clear the table early on.  As we  ready to end  our turn and set the table for our opponent,  we would want to make it impossible or ,at the very least difficult for opponent to make a clear shot . Placing the cue ball close to any other ball , especially one of yours ,is just one way of making a clear strategy to win the opponent.
[26/08/23, 8:42:20 PM] ThiyagaB: As i said, the way you guys describe it is interesting..

But all these are mostly PS games la… 


Girls la kaanum… 
when i asked for a game it can be a casual game too, as long as you like the idea..
[26/08/23, 8:43:42 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: _*Cut the rope_* 

I literally love this game...it is pretty interesting that they combine both puzzle-solving with physics-based mechanics. Players need to strategize and think critically to navigate the levels and feed the cute little monster, Om Nom. The game's charming art style and challenging gameplay make it engaging and enjoyable.....And it is also a vibrant game to play
[26/08/23, 8:44:12 PM] ThiyagaB: 🙌 i am mostly into casual games dhan,

Cut the rope is one of my favourite
[26/08/23, 8:45:08 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: 🙌🏻🙌🏻yeahh ...... It's a cute one
[26/08/23, 8:53:45 PM] ~ ASWIN KUMAR: Assassin s creed💥
[26/08/23, 8:54:47 PM] ~ shriram: Game: Inside 
Reason: The protagonist of the game is a little boy whose shoes we control. The game set in a dystopian world where human beings  are being trafficked, harnessed for their energy and used as lab rats. The game starts with the little boy escaping the facility where all other humans are being held captives. He is soon noticed by those in control of the facility. Our objective as players is to lead the little boy away from the unknown force and away from danger to a safe place. The game is a typical sidescroller with 2dimensional movements. It is a short game with 17 or so hand crafted levels. These levels mostly require us to solve some puzzles to get through them. Throughout these levels we encounter various horrors of the facility and and we must find innovative ways to manipulate our environment. There are a few aspects of this game which in my opinion makes it one of the more interesting games I've played this year. For starters the entire game is monochromatic. Yes, just black and white. Now, one might think that'll only make the game boring. But hell nah, it sets the mood for the dystopian environment I described before. And the sound design is just chefs kiss. It's subtle but not unnoticeable. It's adds so much depth to the game whilst also not interfering with the gameplay itself. Another interesting aspect Is that the game contains no dialogue. Literally 0. How does one convey the story and the setting without dialogues, one might wonder. That's where the atmospheric design of the game and the sound design and the monochromaticity of the game comes into play. The developer has found a brilliant way to convey raw emotions through just the atmosphere and sound, nothing else. What sort of enjoyment does the player get from these kinda games? The answer is, experience. This game will make you think about it, wonder about it for hours after competing it. It offers an unparalleled gameplay experience. Undoubtedly the game is dark. But the story is just so unique and fascinating at some points. The puzzles are fairly intermediate. Nothing too difficult. One of the most important aspect is that Throughout the game we are led to believe that the entire game revolves around us just like any other game. But as we reach the end, we  come to a realisation that we do not occupy a center stage. We are just like everybody else in the game ie nobody. We realise that the entire plot was preplanned, staged by the unknown force just as an experiment(a cruel one at that). 
To conclude, I think this game offers a satirical take on modern society. Whether this take holds good or not remains open to discussion. :)

[26/08/23, 9:25:04 PM] ~ Shakith. A: Game : Blair witch.
Reason: The game focuses on survival horror mechanics and stealth and is played from a first person perspective, requiring the player to use items such as a camera, cellphone, flashlight or a dog, name is *Bullet*, to track and follow the trail of missing nine-year old boy. Along the way, players will find strange wooden dolls, photographs and cassette tapes and will also be tasked with solving puzzles. It gives a interesting horror experience and the main character is suffering from hallucination makes more immersive. It's just a 5 hour game I think so and I have it completed in a day.
[26/08/23, 9:57:53 PM] ThiyagaB: niraya intesting games..  and also it heped me find out how much my son is addicted.. pakkathula utkandhu parthuttu he knew almost all the games ( he is just 13 ) :)

[26/08/23, 10:07:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok now time for our *real game*.. a challenge to the group.
This time we gonna give a reward ( only if we reach 400, 5 more to go.. so mostly we will reach by tmrw )

*Challenge:*
Come up with an idea for one nice game, it can also be a multi player game, The game that's most captivating will be the winner.
Game should be simple to understand, and need not always be a RPG game or a playstation level game.   
The reward is not given for the story you build for the game, but the actual game play and steps. (  though the stories are different, the game play might be same escape or kill).   Games other than RPG like casual play games, simple arcade will get good traction,  as i feel most of you will bring yet another RPG game idea :) 

Now there are two categories for rewards,

1. An idea for Online Game
2. An idea for Offline one ( anyone who comes up with an offline game gets better reward, as its hard than online)


You have time till tomorrow 9 PM.   So take your time, build a cool idea of a game and share.

[27/08/23, 12:24:56 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: *Sans predire (translates to “The inability to predict”)*

Chess is a fairly simple game with rules set in stone. So what if the rules of chess becomes randomized for the each game?  With  even more randomness than the Fischer chess. 

*Mechanics:*

Each match would be a regular game of chess but three modifiers (from a vast pool of pre written modifiers) will be chosen at random. _some examples for modifiers are as follows:_

- _Killing the queen ends the game_
- _The knight can move up to 8 tiles as long as the path makes an L shape_
- _Rooks can't move for more than 3 tiles but now it can leap over other units_
- _When a player has done twenty moves, they may choose to revive one of their pieces and place them back into the game at the starting position. They need to do this in their turn before making a move and this will consume their entire turn, ending it instantly._
- _Pawns get +1 range.(they can move an additional tile)_

And so on. Each game will have different modifiers (randomized), leading to variance in each of the games played. The modifier pool will be large enough for it (say around 32)

Since the modifiers are applied to both the players, it will be balanced and fair. Two modes will be provided - casual with no care for winning or losing and ranked where elo rating comes into consideration.

This will be a live service game so player retention will be a huge determining factor for the success. This part can be brainstormed even more but the few things I came up with are Seasons and cosmetics.

We can have limited time ranked seasons at the end of which the elo will be reset. This way players won't be struck in the same rating and will be able to try again during the start of each season. Each season may also come with their own modifiers that are unique to them and will only be available for that season.

This game will be free to play and the main source of revenue will be cosmetics. There will be themed chessboards and pieces which also comes with their own ambient soundtracks (inspired from the board skins of legends of runeterra).
[27/08/23, 12:26:05 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: *Other modes: Blitz mode:*

The aim of the casual and ranked mode is to be balanced, fair for both side of the players. That's why the modifiers were limited to three. However, the blitz mode will be a chaotic mess. The game starts as a regular game of chess but after every eight sets of moves, a new modifier will be applied. To prevent unfair checkmates, the modifier to be applied will be shown in the side of the screen.

“X modifier will be applied in 7 turns”

“X modifier will be applied in the next turn”

Once it's applied, a new modifier will pop up

“Y modifier will be applied in 8 turns” 

And it will keep on going. This mode is just a breath of fresh air from the regular game mode.
[27/08/23, 12:26:18 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: This is an online pvp btw
[27/08/23, 12:27:20 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Saw fischer chess and thought about the randomization being more than just positions
[27/08/23, 12:32:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Brilliant, 
i saw the Fischer random chess too, 
your idea is really cool, its like T20 cricket moment but for chess, formal conventional chess to more unpredictable entertaining and interesting possibilities.. 

Seriously very good..  You ever tried coding? ‎<This message was edited>

[27/08/23, 12:37:28 PM] ThiyagaB: Definitely give a try, if you feel unity2D demands more of design work than coding, then few other simple frameworks also there..

[27/08/23, 1:55:43 PM] ~ SRI DHARANI: #1000 puzzles

A multiplayer game where you and another opponent face off in a series of puzzles and minigames. The basic working of the game is as follows - the gameplay environment are rooms - each room will have a puzzle/minigame in it and three doors. Each door will have a symbol carved on it and only one of them will get you to the next stage. Choosing a wrong door will result in a game over and the opponent will win.

At the start of the game, you and your opponent will have to go through the puzzle/minigame. Whoever wins it gets an obvious clue to the correct door letting them go to the next level while the one who lost will have to randomly guess the the door. Choosing the wrong door will result in your opponent winning the game and you will have to start from scratch. If both players chose the right door, they will be teleported to the next room with another puzzle/minigame and the gameplay goes on a loop. 

Coins will be rewarded when you select the right door which can be used to get the clue later when you lose. This prevents a player from losing suddenly after winning a lot of rounds consecutively.
[27/08/23, 1:56:56 PM] ThiyagaB: A mix of skill + luck
[27/08/23, 1:57:05 PM] ~ SRI DHARANI: Yes sir

[27/08/23, 4:16:50 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: This is like the one we already had right... " SIMS"
A simulator game developed by Electronic Arts
[27/08/23, 4:17:17 PM] Koushik PEC: yeah i always wanted SIMS to do an TN dlc
[27/08/23, 4:17:26 PM] Koushik PEC: so made one myself
[27/08/23, 6:25:44 PM] ThiyagaB: Nice, 3 more hours to go,
Just 3 entries.. ?? 

Even it’s a simple idea, don’t hesitate to share… most of the times simple ideas used to be biggest hits ..
[27/08/23, 7:14:56 PM] ~ shriram: Name: Yet to be decided

Setting: The game is set in the year 30th century, by which point the entire planet has been taken over by superior androids. Most of the human population has relocated to Kepler452b. The people left on earth live their lives in the shadows, staying out of sight.

Story: The player controls a Paranoid Android, which is extremely fascinated by human beings. It absolutely disgusts the Fake Plastic Trees of its homeland and it strongly believes that its home lies in Kepler 452b along with the humans. An opportunity to escape presents itself when, the android comes to know of a certain shuttle leaving for Kepler in a few days. It comes up with a plan which invloves the android taking the underground tunnel system. The tunnel system consists of 17 major sections which must be traversed. These sections are heavily guarded.

Gameplay: The main weapon, the players possess in their arsenal is a device which can change the magnitude and direction of the "local" gravity. The game consists of 17 levels, each of which is filled with traps, mazes, puzzles, and armed guards. the players must find innovative ways to to traverse this deadly environment with the gravity device. Slight changes in gravity would lead to distortion in the motion of prejectiles like bullets, while significant changes could result in changes in the movements of the androids themselves, The players are also given an option of completely switching the direction of gravity. For example, projectiles from guards could be avoided by not so sognificant changes to the "local" gravity, while sabotaging a huge death laser would require the players to completely switch the direction of gravity. The players are encouraged to use the objects present to find creative ways to overcome the challenges they are presented with. Huge chasms could be crossed by changing the gravity so much that it causes the androids to float in space. The players could also opt to use zero gravity which makes traversal easier, the caveat being, this ability could be used only once per level and the players should also keep in mind that this exponentially increases the accuracy of the fired projectiles as they woudl travel in a linear path in the absence of gravity. All these levels, if completed, would make sense in the end like a Jigsaw Falling Into Place.

Goal: The players are tasked with helping the android overcome the tunnel system and reach the space shuttle(as if it isnt obvious by now lol).
[27/08/23, 7:20:52 PM] ~ Arun: *Alter Boards* 

This game is simple board game of chess, checkers. As per the  name describes this game will alter the position of the board once both the player played their first move and alter the board after both completed their moves.

It is available both online and offline where a person compete with others. This game tends one to think from other player perspectives what kind of move they would possibly make.
The winner can be decided as (person 1 or person 2)not by the (black wins or white wins)and the winner will be awarded with a coin (only in online mode)

There can be a ranking matches as season tournament. The tournament is split into section as per the coin they invest in the game like (10coin,25coin,50coin,100coin)if they win the game they get the return including the opponent.

Once the season is over the final scores will be displayed and reset the score board after the tournament.
[27/08/23, 8:14:49 PM] ThiyagaB: 👏👏
[27/08/23, 8:14:57 PM] ThiyagaB: One more hour
[27/08/23, 8:34:28 PM] ThiyagaB: Verithanam… my son loved this idea more than me :)
[27/08/23, 8:35:38 PM] ThiyagaB: This is simple and fun
[27/08/23, 8:38:47 PM] ~ Sakthi: "Time Traveler's Quest" 

you become a time traveler who explores different time periods. Your job is to find special items and solve puzzles, kind of like a treasure hunt. The game is easy to play and doesn't need the internet.

Imagine walking through beautiful pictures of different times in history, like looking at old photos. You have to find hidden treasures that are really important in history. To get them, you'll need to solve puzzles that match each time. For example, in ancient Egypt, you might need to solve puzzles using their ancient writing, and in the time of clever artists like Leonardo da Vinci, you'll need to solve their tricky puzzles.

As you play, you'll earn rewards for being smart and solving problems. You'll also get to use different time machines, each with their own special powers. Along the way, you can choose to do extra tasks and talk to important people from history. The game is all about having exciting adventures and discovering cool things, and anyone can enjoy it.

The best part is, you can play this game without needing the internet. So, even if you're on a trip or somewhere with no internet, you can still play and have fun. The game is all about exploring, solving puzzles, and having a great time, without needing to be online.
[27/08/23, 8:44:21 PM] ThiyagaB: Can be used to teach history
[27/08/23, 8:47:10 PM] ~ Sakthi: Yes sir, the goal is that, By immersing players in different historical periods and allowing them to interact with the culture, events, and challenges of those times, the game has the power to make history come alive. Through solving puzzles and uncovering hidden treasures, players indirectly learn about historical contexts, artifacts, and the significance of different eras.
[27/08/23, 8:50:39 PM] ThiyagaB: Gamifying is the best way for a learning process..
 we are doing the same, in this community
[27/08/23, 8:51:07 PM] ThiyagaB: Ten more mins
[27/08/23, 8:58:13 PM] ~ ^_^: *Title:*  *MoodMyst*, *Emotopia* , *Emoverse*

*Game Concept:*
This game bridges the gap between player emotions and in-game mechanics. The game utilizes advanced voice and facial recognition technology to detect the player's real-time emotional state, translating it into unique abilities for the in-game character.

*Gameplay Mechanics:*

This game uses voice recognition and camera-based facial analysis to identify the player's emotions. This can include a range of emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, etc.
Each emotion is assigned to a set of unique in-game abilities. 
There will be certain levels that can be cleared based on the emotions we show.
This game can be interesting to play as well as make us control and analyze our emotions, which can help us in any state of reality.
The player's emotional state also influences how NPCs and creatures react. Being angry might intimidate enemies, while being happy could lead to cooperative interactions.
*Story-play:*
The game revolves around a character who gains access to a mystical world where emotions hold the key to unlocking its secrets. The character's journey would involve navigating through different emotional realms, each with its own unique challenges and puzzles.
This helps in building a powerful connection between the player's emotions and character.

*Note:*
Can be multiplayer or stand-alone gameplay
[27/08/23, 8:59:58 PM] ~ Shakith. A: Game name: 9^4.
About: 
The main objective of the game is to find a treasure place. Hero has a watch with him like jack sparrow having that magical compass, but this watch will be different one. It has a 4 digits like 0000 by changing the numbers he can go to different multiverses. This makes the game more interesting as the player will be curious to visit various universes. On each universe he will be in different form and abilities. Eg : In 0001- he will be in lion form. In another universe he will be in a insect form. In each universe there will be a clue to find the treasure and the clue will be in 40 universes. Solving clue will be challenging. The hero can go to any universe one time only. Another group with powerful people also finding the same treasure they also had something similar to the watch to travel, this group will be conflicting the protagonist in different universes when they meet him. At climax, there will be a mass fight between villan and hero where hero in human form with different weapons he gained from different universes. Available in PC and PS5. ‎<This message was edited>

[28/08/23, 7:45:20 PM] ~ Raghul V: Guys, it’s been a year!.. 🎉
Yet no predictable changes in our skills I guess 🥲
I saw a lot of awesome skilled people even from our class (Sam, Nitin, Srini, Sharadha and more…) but not known to everyone that they are good at it 🧐
Maybe you have an idea but not know where to start or how to get it done or even need some small help… if we get to know each other better (i mean on tech 😒), we can work together better and get our works done much more faster and easier.
Trust me! That’s how you reach your client easier… 😎
I'm planning to create a community for us people to share our skills, experiences, knowledge and ideas and to collaborate on each other’s projects. Guess what… it’s a win-win game 🤷🏻‍♂️
Even if your ideas are not technical, maybe someone else there can turn it into a technical problem and solve it with you… that you guys can even sell if it’s worthy 💸
So, whomsoever willing to put in effort and expose your skills to everyone, are welcomed to join the community!… 🫡
That’s it… have some good time ☺️☺️

You are having a full meal, 
Oru regular size Chicken Biriyani
Oru full Omlete
350 ml pepsi

 Now how much steps i should walk to burn the equivalent calories,  so by end of the day, i dont add any extra calorie to my body. 
You can make the right assumptions based on data from google.
[28/08/23, 8:11:24 PM] ~ Raghul V: ‎You deleted this message as admin
[28/08/23, 8:11:52 PM] Koushik PEC: so the total calories consumed by u is 944 calories
[28/08/23, 8:11:56 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: On average, walking burns around 100 calories per mile. 

Chicken Biryani - around 400-500 calories omelette - around 150-200 calories, 
 350ml  Pepsi - 150 calories. 
total - 750-850 calories,

 you might need to walk around 7-8 miles to burn those calories.

Steps = 8 * 2000 = 16000 steps ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/23, 8:13:04 PM] ~ Subha ;): 16k stepss
[28/08/23, 8:13:07 PM] ThiyagaB: 8 miles for just one chicken biriyani??? 😯😯.  how do u arrive at the distance?
[28/08/23, 8:13:13 PM] ThiyagaB: explanation plz
[28/08/23, 8:13:22 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: 1 mile  = 1.6 kilometres
[28/08/23, 8:13:43 PM] ThiyagaB: so there is a standard number of calories burnt per km?
[28/08/23, 8:13:57 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Up and down, walk panna crt aa irkum sir
[28/08/23, 8:14:24 PM] ~ S Divya Darsshini ✨😇: Calories in regular size chicken biryani =600
Calories in one omelette=150
Calories in 350 ml coke=150
Total calories=900
Calorie burnt in single step=0.04
Total steps=900÷0.04
=22,500 steps..
[28/08/23, 8:14:40 PM] ThiyagaB: i am sure there are lot of biriyani lovers here :)  who will be surprised to see this ..
[28/08/23, 8:15:30 PM] ~ Vaishu: Let's assume a regular-sized Chicken Biryani can contain 700 calories.
On average, a full omelette may contain around 300-400 calories. Let's assume it's 350 calories.
A 350 ml can of regular Pepsi contains approximately 150 calories.

So,
Total Calories = Chicken Biryani (700 calories) + Omelette (350 calories) + Pepsi (150 calories) = 1200 calories

To maintain our current weight and not add any extra calories to our body, we'll need to burn these 1200 calories through physical activity, such as walking. The number of steps required to burn calories through walking can vary depending on our weight, walking speed, and other factors. On average, a person burns about 100 calories by walking approximately 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).

Assuming an average walking speed of about 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour), you can use the following estimate:

Number of Steps = (Calories Burned / Calories Burned per Mile) x 2,000

Number of Steps = (1200 / 100) x 2,000 = 24,000 steps

So, we would need to walk approximately 24,000 steps to burn the equivalent calories from your meal and not add any extra calories to our body by the end of the day.
[28/08/23, 8:15:50 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: ‎This message was deleted.
[28/08/23, 8:16:42 PM] ~ ^_^: Sirr 14,000 steps are enough
[28/08/23, 8:16:56 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: You burn about 0.04 calories per step. So one calorie will take about 25 steps. 

Chicken briyani equals 360 calories on average. The data has high variance since it depends a lot on the way it is prepared. 

A omelette prepared with right amount of spices (cause why won't you want it tasty) will make it 183 calories. And Pepsi has listed the 350ml as 150 calories.

So the total calories of the meal is 693. The number of steps will be 693*25 which is  17325 steps
[28/08/23, 8:16:59 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: Yes sir, on average, a person burns around 30-100 calories per kilometer (depending on factors like weight, pace, and metabolism) when walking.
[28/08/23, 8:17:19 PM] Koushik PEC: according to the question u should walk about 20k steps to stay in the same weight however if u want to stay in the same weight u should have eaten (maintenance calories + 944 kal) here maintenance calories are the amount of calories needed by u to stay in the same shape and size maintenance calories should be calculated by ur age, body weight and height so the actual answer depends on the other stuffs he eats and also things he does
[28/08/23, 8:17:34 PM] ThiyagaB: explain plz.. may be u have a different technique than others..   pesikitte nadandha extra calorie kurayum nu calculate pantiya ?
[28/08/23, 8:17:39 PM] ~ Dharshuu: total calories may be 1160 (a rough estimation)... no.of steps  required to burn a calorie can vary on diff factors such as weight,speed etc.., let's consider on avg walking a mile can burn 100 calories...then 1160/100=11.6 miles... so approximately it may be 11.6 miles...  the assumptions may vary differently from person to person though...
[28/08/23, 8:17:51 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: Assuming that the Chicken Biriyani contains around 700 calories, the egg contains around 70 calories, and the 350 ml pepsi contains around 150 calories, the total calorie intake would be approximately 920 calories.

On average, you only burn 30-40 cal per 1000 steps. So assuming it roughly to be 40 per 1000 rate, you need to walk 23,000 steps to burn the cal. But this step count may change according to the height of a person
[28/08/23, 8:18:04 PM] ThiyagaB: Devil few days a missing.. now back
[28/08/23, 8:18:09 PM] ~ ^_^: Regular Size Chicken Biryani: 360 calories
Full Omelette: Approximately 70calories
350 ml Pepsi: Approximately 150 calories

Calories to burn: 580 calories
Average calories burned per mile: 100 calories
Average steps per mile: 2,000 to 2,500 steps

Number of miles to walk: 580 calories / 100 calories/mile ≈ 5.8 to 5.8 miles

Total steps needed: 2,000 steps/mile * 5.8 miles = 11,600 steps to 2,500 steps/mile * 5.8 miles = 14,500 steps
[28/08/23, 8:18:15 PM] ~ Harisangar A P: 16000 steps sir
[28/08/23, 8:18:36 PM] ~ ^_^: Approximately exact details Sir ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/23, 8:18:46 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: I did some additional math for fun. An average height person at an average pace covers 0.64 metres in one step. So it will take around 11km of walking to burn all that calories
[28/08/23, 8:19:05 PM] ~ ^_^: Full omelette its showing for 3 eggs or 2 large eggs....
[28/08/23, 8:20:02 PM] ThiyagaB: I like to see some new names..  approx 110 ppl voted..  but answer panna 10-15 ppl only..   

Any biriyani lovers out thr..
[28/08/23, 8:20:13 PM] ~ Karan: One cricket match
[28/08/23, 8:20:53 PM] ThiyagaB: superru..   a biriyani after a cricket match is the best..    Nalla vayiru fulla saaptu, poi matcha aaduva nee :)
[28/08/23, 8:21:32 PM] ~ Aadhitya sriram: Assuming that the main goal is to 'not add any extra calories', I think one would just need to exist and go about their day as the average maintenance calories for a human being is 2000 kcal. So 0 steps.
[28/08/23, 8:21:47 PM] ~ Subha ;): Chicken biriyani (serves 1 avg) = 290 calories 
One full omelette= 74-75 calories 
350ml of pepsi= 150 calories


Calories to burn : 514
Total miles to walk: about 6-7
1mile = 2k steps 
Total steps: 12k-14k
[28/08/23, 8:22:09 PM] ThiyagaB: your first response here?
[28/08/23, 8:22:27 PM] ~ Aadhitya sriram: Yes, Sir.
[28/08/23, 8:27:03 PM] ~ Karan: Yes sir,after 10 mins approximately 20℅ would be digested. So we can continue to play normally after :)
[28/08/23, 8:27:50 PM] ThiyagaB: first response la ye kalakitta ..  thats the right one :) . 

You get it for today.
[28/08/23, 8:28:26 PM] ~ Aadhitya sriram: Thank you Sir ❤️
[28/08/23, 8:28:46 PM] ThiyagaB: Again its the approximation..    Mathematically its fine, you dont have to do much..  a good active lifestyle , and your body will take care.

Eat well, and also be conscious on your eating..   romba saapdum bodhu, just know.. oru full chicken biriyani is equivalent to atleast 10km walking or one full cricket match as karan told :)

https://chat-take2-1.web.app/

Its a simple group chat app, in which you can use AI to help you make decisions or query within the group and based on the chat context.. it is really fun to use this demo. 
It’s still in very early stage, but i am really glad someone from this group can create new product with minimal guidance from me . 👏👏👏

We will see more such projects, anyone willing with cool idea , give it a try.. more than any certifications, these little projects add lots of value to your profile

Hackathons are one of the best ways you can showcase your talent beyond your small circle and more than winning the participation itself will give you lots of exposure.. and if you win, it almost guarantees a good career.

there are few hackathons our students shared with me, posting here for benefit of all,

Please post the name of the events hosted by your department or college here. ( it can be non technical too like a sports event) it helps all others to know abt events across all colleges.

Recently i bought an electric car after a lots of hesitation and researching the pros and cons, right now i am enjoying the ride in my new EV..   So thought of asking today's quiz based on EV.
[01/09/23, 8:14:45 PM] ~ ^_^: Congratulations Sir🤝🏻🎉...neenga than oru electric ride kudukkanum ippo😂
[01/09/23, 8:15:26 PM] ~ Vignesh: Congratulations sir🎉🎉
[01/09/23, 8:17:05 PM] ThiyagaB: Quiz:

You are going to help your friend make a decision whether to   buy an electric bike ( or scooter) or not, 
 so the question is to compare the cost of similar petrol vehicle,  and the running cost of ev bike vs petrol bike, and give numbers if its useful to spend the extra cost in EV vehicle  and suggest if he can buy it or not. 

Asusual there is no single answer,  the best answer depends on how many factors you think of, and give a personalized advice.
You can get the approx cost of bikes , petrol charge, charging cost ( electricity cost per unit) etc.. ellame you can assume.

[01/09/23, 8:20:19 PM] ~ ^_^: Will surely try for a meet up Sir🤝🏻
[01/09/23, 8:21:40 PM] Koushik PEC: If my friend is not gonna go regular long trips or just use it locally I'll recommend him the EV but since it is not main stream yet if the battery goes down the replacement will be around the price of a new EV i guess
[01/09/23, 8:22:42 PM] ~ Santhosh: Lets assume the ev and bike price is same
Since there is tax benefits for ev 
There are some cost benefits for ev bikes
Nowadays the cost of petrol reached nearer to 110rs
On average  a working person rides a bike for 60-80km per day 
So it cost around 100-200rs depends on cc of that vehicle
On average the cost of ev charging of bike is less..
Ev bikes have better economical compared to petrol engine bikes ‎<This message was edited>
[01/09/23, 8:23:12 PM] Koushik PEC: If the person decides to buy a new EV instead of battery replacement the previous vehicle is scrap i guess so which absolutely increases carbon footprint

[01/09/23, 8:26:14 PM] ~ Pranesh: If my friend is going to buy a ev vehicle i would suggest him to check for the Maintenance: Electric bikes generally have lower maintenance costs than petrol vehicles due to fewer moving parts
And check for the resale value
[01/09/23, 8:27:33 PM] ThiyagaB: Try to include, a calculation including the electricity cost vs petrol. Say for e.g. to ride 1000km, how much it costs in EV vs how much in petrol
[01/09/23, 8:28:35 PM] Koushik PEC: The cost of electricity may be less sir but cost of time is more precious sir :) ‎<This message was edited>
[01/09/23, 8:35:14 PM] ~ Muruganantham: whatever the cost may be , electric vehicles produce less pollutants than petrol vehicles. electric vehicles are better for our environment. as it produce less pollutants it also saves our health. nothing is more precious than our mother earth and our health. finally considering this i would always suggest electric vehicles.

[01/09/23, 8:47:34 PM] ThiyagaB: sari appo innaiku no one gets reward :)
[01/09/23, 8:48:10 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: Petrol cost- 100rs per litre
Mileage for petrol vehicle - 40-50km
Ev- on an average ,it takes 30wh energy to travel 1mile. So for a 36V, 10A battey, u can expect it to travel 12 miles per full charge( 36×10=360, 360/30=12)

 electricity bill cost :

Power consumption per day = 36v x 10a x 4h = 1440 watt-hours (Wh)

Power consumption per day in kWh = 1440 Wh / 1000 = 1.44 kWh

Electricity bill per day = 1.44 kWh x 4.8 rupees/kWh = 6.91 rupees

Even though we pitch in a relatively higher principal, ev is quite efficient when compared to the petrol vehicle

[01/09/23, 8:53:09 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: 15 mins
[01/09/23, 8:53:47 PM] ~ Logesh: I would suggest an ev (scooter ) if it's used for short rides.A ev scooter costs 1.3lakhs and a petrol scooter costs around a 1 lakh.For a petrol scooter it costs around 3k for doing 1000km including its service costs.In case of ev it will be few hundreds.It would cost around 10-30(will take 1-3kwh which costs around 30rs)for a full charge which can give a range of 100kms.So the extra cost for the petrol vehicle when spent in ev will be worthy .Since the EVs require battery replacement after 4-5 years,the amount that we could save in buying and maintaining this ev will help in battery replacement(which costs it's around 90k).But this is in case of short rides.The reliability of ev scooters are not yet proved to the best when it comes to long rides.So if the usage is high then going for a petrol vehicle is the right choice.On the other hand if it comes to short rides ev could be a better option.Resale values of petrol vehicles is also a good when compared to ev.But when it comes to environment...it's always better to choose an ev
[01/09/23, 8:53:56 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: extracted from articles or just custom searching in google
[01/09/23, 8:54:27 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: It's a mixture😅
[01/09/23, 8:54:49 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: ok.. I wil try to keep in tht level for my nxt ans
[01/09/23, 8:55:11 PM] ThiyagaB: Superr you thought about the battery replacement cost which is really a huge factor
[01/09/23, 9:03:09 PM] ~ N G K: Firstly,Electric vehicles reduce air pollution, decrease greenhouse gas emissions.It creates a positive impact on environment compared to petrol vehicle.
 
The Indian government had several schemes to promote electric vehicles. GSTrate for electric vehicles was reduced to 5%, making EVs more affordable.

Electric vehicles typically have lower maintenance costs

Calculation:
      Assuming an electric two-wheeler with a range of 80 km per full charge and an electricity rate of ₹8per kWh.

1000 km ÷ 80 km = 12.5 
Let's say the battery capacity is 2 kWh, so each full charge costs ₹16 (2 kWh x ₹8per kWh).
Total cost : 12.5   x ₹16 per charge = ₹200.

Petrol Vehicle:
Assuming a petrol scooter that gives an average mileage of 50 km per liter and a petrol price of ₹100 per liter:

1000 km ÷ 50 km = 20 liters
Total cost : 20 liters x ₹100 per liter = ₹2,000.

Comparatively,fuel for petrol vehicle costs 10 times higher.
Finally,I will suggest my friend to buy electric vehicle.

[01/09/23, 9:06:37 PM] SHIVABALAN MANI🦂: In my opinion opting for EV is not a really good decision economically for a long period of time!🙃 

As of now the battery life of an Electric car is around 6-7 years . After 6-7 years you gotta change the battery which costs more than 3/4  of the price of the car!🫠

The on road price of base Variant of  Tata Nexon EV  now is 14-15 lakh . And they're assuring a battery  life of 8 years or run distance 1,60,000 km whichever comes first. Approximately let's say in 8 years mostly we'll cover 90k to 100k kms. And after that you gotta spend 7 lakhs on battery (which will increase in future for sure🙃). 

The same base Variant of a Tata Nexon Petrol costs  8 lakhs as of now . And if it is being driven for 100k kms the fuel price will be around 6-6.5 lakh . And other services and etc ., price let's assume it to be 2 lakh for 100k kms . 

So you have to spend 7 lakh after 100 k kms for EV . So it's 14l+7l=21 Lakh approximately

While in the case of Petrol it'll be 15-16 l at 100k kms

Obviously you spend 5-6 lakh more in EV car  when compared to Petrol car at the end of 100k kms🙃.

Of course EV may be less polluting , but it is definitely not affordable for middle class people to get an EV car and replace the battery after 6-7 years

And being a crazy car enthusiast I feel  EV cars can  never give the amazing feel that the fuel cars gives 🥲 

You can go with EV cars only if you're ready to face these issues ‎<This message was edited>
[01/09/23, 9:06:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Your first msg??
[01/09/23, 9:07:09 PM] ~ N G K: Yes sir
[01/09/23, 9:08:12 PM] ThiyagaB: Summa irundha pasangala usupethitomo, 🤔
sama answers ah varudhu
[01/09/23, 9:10:06 PM] ~ Arun Karthick Saravanan: Hai sir…First of all congratulations for your car❤️‍🔥I accept that ev are the future and doesnot polutes the environment But personally i would prefer buying petrol/diesel engines
 
Reason:
 In ev we can save money by not spending in fuel and also cost per kilometre of EV is Rs.2.5 rupees and in petrol cars per kilometre cost is Rs.6.8 considering Tata Nexon EV and Tata Nexon petrol which I explained in the below calculation. But one thing in EV, we have to consider is the battery life of the car. Considering Tata Nexon EV battery life is average of eight years are it comes up to 1,60,000 km, the price of a battery in Tata Nixon Is seven lakhs from which we could afford Tata Nexon petrol car. So the reliability of the EV is very poor. In todays scenario. If we consider Toyota Innova has an example, even Toyota Innova is so costly the reliability of Toyota is mind blowing a well maintained. Toyota Innova can travel more than 10,00,00 kilometre in their lifetime. So from my opinion, buying EV is 
Not the most cost efficient choice. Also one thing we have to consider consider is the charging time of battery and average EV battery takes 7 to 15 hours to full charge and if we travel to long distances, we have to invest in buying a charge kit for EV is 33,000.
Also, there are people who who takes their EV even to Ladakh, where they want to charge their EV in every hotels they stay so they have to pay for the electricity bill and also the rent. So from my opinion buying EV is a bad choice..sorry sir😂.

Also as a car enthusiast I would recommend buying a diesel or petrol cars as we Are the last generation to experience the powerful, petrol and diesel engines. You can think that petrol and diesel engine scan pollute environment, but according to BS6 norms of the central government ,emission of petrol and diesel engines is very less. So my choice of buying a car is diesel Innova crysta as we are the last generation to experience, diesel cars and manual cars too
And I also expect more questions related to automobile too☺️ ‎<This message was edited>

[01/09/23, 9:14:13 PM] ~ Arun: If my friend is going to buy a vehicle I would tell to consider these factors
1)kilometre per charge
On average the ev vehicle gives 100km for a full charge (it depends on bike 1kwh-3kwh). So the cost of current 6-10 rupee it would cost around 20-30 rupee
The petrol bike gives average 40-60 km per liter (103 rupee)
2)Maintenance
The serive cost of ev is much less than petrol vehicle (for ev it would cost around in hundreds and for petrol vehicles it cost in thousands)
3)returns and replacement
The replacement of battery would cost around 50-70k but the resale value is low
The resale value of petrol is high compared to ev. 
The replacement of battery in ev is relatively lower cost compared to the service and petrol cost of petrol vehicles
[01/09/23, 9:14:32 PM] ThiyagaB: Can see that aggressive :)

As someone who's been through 'CEG,' I understand the significance of this journey. I'm deeply passionate about the field of ECE, and I have a burning desire to merge it with my other interests. I have a plethora of ideas that I'm eager to bring to life.

What really excites me is the world of programming. I strongly believe in the quote, 'Every programmer is a coder, but every coder is not a programmer.' This perfectly encapsulates my approach. I'm dedicated to sharing insights on coding and various programming languages.

So, let's embark on this knowledge-sharing adventure together, and I look forward to the enriching experience ahead! 🌟🤝💻

Problem solving is the key for any programming or any job for that matter, so what we do, is every alternate days ( mostly Mon, Wed, Fri), will ask a quiz , sometimes simple, sometimes complex, sometimes tricky,. 

and whoever solves it first and gives proper explanation gets a kutti reward. (10₹ to 50₹ depending on the quiz and the way you reply) 

and we also have 'open ended question' for research and debate on tue, thurs and weekends. 

so innaiku oru small easy quiz , since we start with many new ppl.

[04/09/23, 8:15:03 PM] ~ srini: If we consider the chessboard to be a boolean matrix represented by:

{
0 - Untouched by the Rook
1- The Rook has been here atleast once }

Then considering a smaller model of 2x2 boxes, at the intial position we get:
{ 0, 0
  1, 0 }

And it takes exactly one move to turn the 0s to 1s which results in 3 moves and since we have to end at the same spot we get an additional move which results in the answer n^2 where n represents either the row or column of the matrix.

Extending this to an 8x8 matrix (chesboard) we get the answer as 64

[04/09/23, 8:23:24 PM] ~ Rahul Balaji: I don't know if it is the right answer or not 
But this is my answer 128 
Because in the questions you mentioned that it takes 64 moves to cover all the boxes in the chess board and the rook return to its starting position in the reverse order of the chess board is also 64 moves.That why 64+64=128 moves

[04/09/23, 8:33:14 PM] ~ 🤹‍♂️꧁P҉r҉a҉n҉a҉v҉꧁vikraman꧂🤿: Now i guess it can also be done by 14 moves 
After reaching the last square in the eighth row, the rook will have covered all 64 squares. Now, it can return to its starting position by moving directly back in the same path it used before, which requires 7 moves.

So, the total number of moves is 7 (covering the board) + 7 (returning to the starting position) = 14 moves.
[04/09/23, 8:33:44 PM] ThiyagaB: nee fast man da.. but qn la.. we should cover one cell for each move..

[05/09/23, 6:41:50 PM] ThiyagaB: 1. What inspired you to become a teacher and can you share an unforgettable teaching moment or a student's success story that touched your heart?

[05/09/23, 6:49:21 PM] ThiyagaB: 3. How do you strike a balance between traditional teaching methods and incorporating technology in this group or your workplace?

In my opinion, Conventional teaching methods are no longer relevant,  its boring, no intent or purpose.  
More than technology,  the intent is to be personalized, and feel human touch.  But its hard to personalize when u have 100s, so we use tech to analyze and personalize in scale.
[05/09/23, 6:50:51 PM] ThiyagaB: 4. What role does lifelong learning play in a teacher's career?
Students are getting smarter, so teacher should learn lifelong,  atleast not to look dumb and also to have some fun while teaching

[05/09/23, 7:00:13 PM] ThiyagaB: 5. What will education look like in the next decade, and how should students prepare for these changes?

Even for next 100 yrs, one thing remains constant is 'Problem solving', so for students only 2 things, 
1. explore outside college or school, see how companies, ppl are solving problems  ( or creating new problems ;) )
2. Then Point 1. will lead you to the tools/knowledge, acquire them to stay relevant to industry.
[05/09/23, 7:05:10 PM] ThiyagaB: 6. How are you teachers so informal that you easily mingle with students. Are you planning to be the change?

Whether a mentor or manager or father, i am informal, its just me.   
Also for last few decades in the name of 'discipline' , the irrelevant methodologies followed by educational institutions triggered me to start this community.

Whether it works or not.. I dont know..  i am just eager to see how this evolves..

[05/09/23, 7:10:41 PM] ThiyagaB: perfectly said..   

For institutions, to manage bigg crowd.. they need these disciplines and rules..  and all these are derived from colonialism,

when i worked in service companies, we used to wear tie, shoe, perfect hair cut la..  but the client who visits will come in shorts, beach shirt ..

So todays icebreaker, 

Who has birthdays in this month of september,  if you are shy you dont have to tell the dates, just say 'me' :)

[05/09/23, 9:08:34 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok lets move on to today's qn.   


*In the International Chess Tournaments, we have seen lots of talent from tamilnadu represented India from Viswanath anand to Praggnanandhaa,

Apart from the fact ppl are smart here, why do u think tamilnadu is able to produce lots of Grandmasters.

When i tried to understand this, it was so interesting and it gave a crucial answer on how a society can improve, thats why thought of asking this to the group today. 


A proper insight answer will get upto 50₹ depends on quality of answer.
[05/09/23, 9:09:33 PM] ThiyagaB: infact 26 out 70 grandmasters are frm tamilnadu

[05/09/23, 9:17:04 PM] ~ Santhosh: The parents motivates the children to learn and play chess rather than other sport so that they will gain knowledge and be brilliant

[05/09/23, 9:28:40 PM] Koushik PEC: I don't wanna be harsh but I think the literacy rate brings this difference like more literacy rate more parents want their children to be more intelect which made their children to join games like chess and scams like mid brain activation 😅
[05/09/23, 9:30:57 PM] ~ Surya Narayanan: Sir maybe casteism
[05/09/23, 9:30:57 PM] ~ Santhosh: As of my knowledge,when someone plays good for their country or their state , people start to follow them and enjoy it watching and start to do like them and wishes to be like them, that's how started popularity of cricket after winning 1983 world cup in india
If india won any gold in any game in olympics people just speak about it and never think about other games That's why football is still not famous in india ( i believe)
When vishy becomes GM and becomes the world's no 1, the Tamilans wish to do they same as others and become successful by practicing...
[05/09/23, 9:32:09 PM] ~ 🖤⃝𝑺ⓊⓃⒾⓁ. 🖤⃝𝑺: Tamil Nadu people's oda culture laiyee errukuu so.,more grandmaster were produced i think soo
[05/09/23, 9:34:20 PM] ~ N G K: Chennai is also known as India’s chess capital as it gave the country its forebearers of international chess. India’s first International Master Manuel Aaron and first GrandMaster Viswanathan Anand are from Chennai.India’s first Women GrandMaster (WGM), Subbaraman Vijayalakshmi is also from Tamil Nadu.

Chess clubs:
From a chess club that was formed in the early 1960s to very active district and state chess federations, we have a chess culture in the state. Even the Indian Chess Federation was based in Chennai for a very long time in initial years.One of the first well-known clubs in Chennai was started in 1972 by Manuel Aaron, who dominated chess in India from the 1960s to 1980s. The monthly membership fee was just 20 rupees.The Tal  chess Club created the city’s first chess revolution, resulting in the emergence of Anand and numerous other players in the 90s.the Velammal Vidyalaya in Mogappair is the next revolutionary chess club.  Since the beginning of 2005 ,15  grandmasters are from Velammal.

Ancient history:
There are claims that chess, known as 'Sathurangam' in the Tamil, could have originated in Tamil Nadu. The ancient 'Sathuranga Vallabhanathar' temple at Tiruvarur  is a proof.

In conclusion, Tamil Nadu has a strong chess culture with a rich history of chess players and enthusiasts. Chess is widely taught and promoted in schools.The success of chess players like Viswanathan Anand has inspired many youngsters in the state to take up chess seriously.Parents also give their support.

[05/09/23, 9:36:13 PM] ~ Rahul Balaji: It's Because of the support given by the parents and school to develop the students in chess.The parents believe that "Chess helps the children to develop their memory power".They also believe that by developing the memory power ,the children will get good at studies.It will not take much expenses in learning and buying things for chess

1. Viswanath Anand
2. Profit making bcuz of success
3. schools and parents mindset
[05/09/23, 9:58:15 PM] ThiyagaB: all of them are right :) and i will summarize along with what i read in an article,  

this is called 'network effect' 

In this case its how humans tend to form clusters to succeed.  But It needs one man and one success from 'V anand' created that buzz,
so tamilnadu ppl start to relate themselves to this succes
then businesses uses this opportunity and opened lots of training institutes including schools
Govt used this opportunity to promote 

Students got a sense of pride and joined these classes, 
The successful ppl coaches the younger generations

So this combined network effect, now creates a strong platform now in tamilnadu. 

This same applies to Cricket, JEE coaching, Engineering colleges etc.. :) ‎<This message was edited>

So in conclusion i think that  supportive families, mentorship, and a peaceful mindset might be the place where we lead...
[06/09/23, 3:08:34 AM] ~ Pharaoh Suriya: If you ask me, I do think it's one of the basic results of evolution at play. And humans especially have knowledge that gets passed on beyond generations other than through genetics by something called culture. This is an extremely powerful tool as the only thing that a living thing is concerned with seems to be the survival of its kind and so will be willing to do anything to achieve that and that thing is generally termed intelligence. So when we see something that we know is going to make us live longer or help us reproduce, it checks in for things necessary to survive by our genetic material whose only purpose is to continue existing. So, we tend to do such things and keep it in higher regard. For example, ancient humans saw forest fire and how animals that got cooked in them tasted and how they were better because they won't cause much diseases as the bacteria will be destroyed by heat and that became an incentive to learn how to create a fire, similarly with other things, everything just ensures one's survival. So in today's world money and fame can both keep you above others of our species which means better survival, this is what motivates every human to do things like these. Coming to Tamil Nadu I guess we are somewhat too stuck to culture though I'm not sure why but I do have guesses, maybe because our education system is still the very system created by the British to create slaves, like you aren't programmed to ask questions or be creative and both of these are discouraged in our society and therefore we tend to be extremely not adventurous and do things that are already established to ensure our survival, so if it comes to sports you go with cricket because it's established, similarly with IITs like I was in that rabbit hole for most of my schooling, like Sundar Pichai was enough to advertise for that and I think the same applies to chess, we have become lazy and less adventurous due to our society and education system that discourage us from having creativity we just do what we know will help us survive and in that way as people have said earlier it's no surprise that chess is a cultural thing and few big names in the industry is enough incentives to take that as a livelihood, if you ask me, L for the education system and a bigger L for the society, one advice would be to please use more creativity don't listen to toxic people that say being adventurous is stupid. Thank you 😊

[06/09/23, 7:21:54 PM] ThiyagaB: Hi ppl, Good evening.. 

Our long pending DSA session is now planned for this sunday by @918015227849.    As mentioned earlier,  its tough or irrelevant to take this session to hundreds at a time, instead we want a focused smaller group. 

So we planned to do one quick assessment today 9pm,

1. The assessment has 10 questions, and it ll hardly takes 2 mins or max 5 mins.
2. The assessment will be open only for 30 mins,  from 9 to 9:30, any responses submitted after 9:30 is not qualified. 

I request students who are familiar with DSA to skip this assessment, as we target ppl who are really interested but cannot understand the concepts. 

We will send the meeting invite to the selected ppl via email, 
Please note  the selection is NOT ONLY based on marks,  we will have multiple ways to do the selection.

[06/09/23, 9:51:46 PM] ThiyagaB: So DSA topic konjam thalli veippom, until this sunday. 

Next one huge topic, 
 as we grow bigger and bigger, i was thinking how do we sustain this community and how it can be driven by the community itself,    During this initial stages, i was so doubtful,  but now i got lots of trust on you ppl,  the way you think , the way you respect each other in community..  so i thought we will try new initiative 'Weekly Manager' for this group.

Every week, one college will take care of this group handling quizzes, initiating open discussions and sharing knowledge,  ( i will be there ofcourse responding to every msg, moderating ), 

To begin with we are going to start with Panimalar Engineering College.   @918525824924  and @916382120455  will drive and other panimalar students Koushik, Ayaan and others also can help them drive it for a week.

[07/09/23, 8:32:16 PM] Koushik PEC: Today's question is again a open ended question,

Nowadays majority of the population has access to internet , people can conduct researches by the comfort of their home instead of depending on labs completely .

Should research papers be freely accessible to the public, or is it reasonable to require subscriptions to access them, considering the widespread availability of the internet and the evolving landscape of academic publishing?
[07/09/23, 8:35:15 PM] ThiyagaB: PEC opening eh research, scientist range ku poitangale..  :).
[07/09/23, 8:36:05 PM] ~ Nithish: I have two different views on this...

1st:
I have published one research paper and from my experience, research papers should be opensource because, while working i myself have 
referred similar past works and ive referred to original papers about algorithms that i used in the research, also papers provide some extra information than other tutorials, and while being freely accessible it can used by anyone getting started and public benifit is there.
Also, if your work is good enough, you might get internation collaboration.

2nd:
The amount of time spent by me brainstroming on each step of research is be invaluable(from my POV), and also getting the article published required a lot of work, like when you submit to a journal they won't straight away publish it, they will look for errors, you have to correct and submit again, then for publishing also you have to pay certain amount based on the journal(I paid $150). But, that is what keeps the journal running, without the fees journals might struggle to survive. And the fees is also used as way to pay the reviewers who are reviewing your papers which is (Quality Control). Finally, the freely accessible research might lead to the exploitation of researchers, as certain entities could use their work without compensation.

In conclusion, the question of whether research papers should be freely accessible or require subscriptions is a nuanced one.
[07/09/23, 8:36:24 PM] ~ Naveen💎: Only pec students must answer the question??
[07/09/23, 8:36:35 PM] ThiyagaB: No no
[07/09/23, 8:36:40 PM] Koushik PEC: Naa bro
[07/09/23, 8:37:17 PM] ThiyagaB: the idea is, every week one college will take care of asking the quiz and running this community.. this week is PEC,  

and ofcourse we need participation from u all..

[07/09/23, 8:43:20 PM] ~ Nithish: It is what it is... I think sir, i thought of answering from different views, like everyone won't have the same view right
[07/09/23, 8:43:32 PM] ~ Nithish: I tried covering both positive and negative sides
[07/09/23, 8:43:49 PM] ~ sam: Well, whats the point in the subscription requirement when anyone can access it just using mod version of it? My point is if a person is truly interested in research he would definitely find a way to access it no matter the subscription or anything but for the people who just want to know what the research talks about, they can just use those mod versions. And as everything is digitalised subscription doesn't seem to slow down the people's ambition. We all know what happens when a movie gets released in any OTT platforms, the next moment we have it in torrent or any other illegal websites.

End of the day it all depends on the motive of the person who offers subscription based research papers, if he wants to make money, no one's stopping him but on the other hand, if he just wants to let people know, he'll release it for free. 

In my opinion, there's no point in  releasing the papers with subscription requirement.
[07/09/23, 8:44:00 PM] ~ ^_^: Both had positive sides with different sort of perspectives
[07/09/23, 8:45:08 PM] ~ ^_^: But don't u think we are allowed to share our knowledge for money??
[07/09/23, 8:45:20 PM] ~ ^_^: That's what schools and colleges have been following
[07/09/23, 8:45:50 PM] ~ sam: Releasing research paper online cant be compared with schools or colleges
[07/09/23, 8:46:11 PM] ~ ^_^: Irrespective of what's going on round-the-clock...people are selling their knowledge for money...any ideas or thought process on this?

[07/09/23, 8:48:21 PM] ~ sam: Yeah as they say if you are good at anything dont do it for free. Yes i accept that but theres no point in doing so, end of the day someone us gonna create a mod version of it and release it. But some genuine people who are not aware of those mods will buy them, Lemme ask u something, if you are offered something for free and the same version is available paid too, what would u go for?
[07/09/23, 8:48:30 PM] ~ ^_^: Just like what kind of torrent file or sites u get to watch a movie without visiting the theatre immediately after its release
[07/09/23, 8:49:52 PM] ~ Fadhil: Absolutely for the free one dhan
[07/09/23, 8:50:21 PM] ~ ^_^: Agreeing to Nature's mindset I would surely go for free...but do u really accept that you are getting stuff for free nowadays?
[07/09/23, 8:51:52 PM] ~ ^_^: For example if u visit KFC or McD or some other fast food stall and they offer u a burger say rs.50...after u accept it they ask us whether u want extra cheese or extra whatever...and when u agree they charge for it
[07/09/23, 8:52:10 PM] ~ sam: Yeah, i get free courses, free movies and everything thats digitalised.
[07/09/23, 8:52:35 PM] ~ sam: Bro kfc mcdonalds cant be compared with something thats digitalised
[07/09/23, 8:52:53 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: In an idealistic world, knowledge should be free for all. But as the answers before mentioned, the reviewing and quality control is very important. Social media is free, anybody can share their knowledge but because of the lack of reviewing it is just a muddied pool of mess filled with rumours, propaganda and trashy stuff all thanks to the almighty algorithm.

Knowledge is free but it requires someone to compile and review them. So I think it is worth paying for the process. 

Wikipedia is one of those sources that is well reviewed, runs solely based on donations (and they are running out of funds so go donate peeps, it's only 25 rupees per month) and it's completely free showcasing that it's possible.

So the people who do it should be paid in some way or another (donations, ads?, Incentives from govt(impossible though)) but the knowledge should not be locked behind a paywall. But this is an idealistic situation and in the current circumstances you have to pay for a course or journal to get the best compiled source of knowledge.
[07/09/23, 8:53:17 PM] ~ ^_^: Then how do u give the example of torrent movies with research papers 🙂
[07/09/23, 8:53:43 PM] ~ sam: Movies that are released on OTT platforms?
[07/09/23, 8:53:59 PM] ~ ^_^: I never compared the way it goes... anyway it was just an example
[07/09/23, 8:54:08 PM] ~ ^_^: Theater
[07/09/23, 8:54:25 PM] ~ sam: Netflix demands for subscription but who pays, of course there are some but everythings available online for free

[07/09/23, 8:56:46 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: People pay because it's convenient. When netflix came out the number of pirated downloads went down significantly because it was easier to pay 5$ for a subsciprtion and get everything. THis is not the case now as we require like 5+ subscriptions to get everything
[07/09/23, 8:56:58 PM] ~ Regular Guy: bruh you from AU?

[07/09/23, 9:07:30 PM] SHIVABALAN MANI🦂: In my perspective research papers should be accessible only on subscription 🙂 accessible to everyone may sound good but it'll spoil the quality of the research! Subscription will act as a factor that contributes more to the intense quality!

Those subscriptions will help a lot to the researcher in multiple ways ! It'll trigger them to invest them in the research itself and it'll increase the intensity and quality of their research! 

Yk you'll give your best when you do it for some 💰,than doing it for free! the same with research! Researchers will bring out their best when they get some 💰for their efforts🤑
[07/09/23, 9:07:46 PM] ~ Fadhil: Yeah, the amt meets our day to day needs

[07/09/23, 9:31:38 PM] ~ Fadhil: So finally the conclusion is the debate over open access to research papers is ongoing. Advocates for open access argue that making research freely accessible benefits society by promoting knowledge sharing and innovation. However, publishers argue that subscription fees are necessary to cover the costs of peer review and publication. Finding a balance between these viewpoints is crucial to ensure continued scientific progress and accessibility.

In a fictional election featuring five candidates (W, X, Y, Z, and Q), 500 voters are asked to rank their preferences for these candidates from 1st to 5th place. How many distinct ways can these 500 voters express their preferences through these rankings without specifying the actual number?

Right answer will get a reward of ₹20

[08/09/23, 9:37:52 PM] ~ Sheegan Sri 👻: since there are 5ranks for candidates and the 1st person has 5choice and 2nd has 4choice since first person was nominated for that rank so the answer would be 5! or 120 possible way of ranking if we are considering with the number of voters then the answer would be of 120^500 ‎<This message was edited>

[08/09/23, 9:44:29 PM] ~ Sahana Sara💫: 60,000

[08/09/23, 9:46:08 PM] ~ Sreecharan: There are 5! ways to rank 5 candidates, but each ranking can be expressed by 500 different voters, one for each voter who has that ranking. So the number of distinct ways to express the voters' preferences is 5! * 500 = 120 * 500 = 60,000

[08/09/23, 9:58:56 PM] ~ Sheegan Sri 👻: i can provide the answer short explanation with a small sample space with 5 voters and 3candidates for 3 candidates there will be 3! ranking positions for each voters also there will 3! ways to each voters so in this case the answer will be 3!^5 (3!*3!*3!*3!*3!)
[08/09/23, 9:59:06 PM] ~ Nanda Kumaran: Among those five personalities one should be ranked 1st in 5 ways so 4 people can have the 2nd rank (since one should occupy first rank) ,three people can have third rank and it goes on , total voters =500 and 5! Is 120 so the total permutations would be 120*500=60000. But the question is to calculate the distinct ways so when we delete the duplicate it should be 5! I think so. ‎<This message was edited>
[08/09/23, 9:59:39 PM] ~ Dharun: you can calculate the number of distinct ways using permutations. 

There are 5 candidates, so for the first place, any of the 5 candidates can be chosen. Afterward, for the second place, there are 4 remaining choices, then 3 for the third place, 2 for the fourth place, and the last candidate will be in the fifth place

So, the number of distinct ways to express their preferences is:
5 (choices for 1st place) × 4 (choices for 2nd place) × 3 (choices for 3rd place) × 2 (choices for 4th place) × 1 (choice for 5th place) = 5! = 120 distinct ways.

There are 120 distinct ways for the 500 voters to express their preference

[09/09/23, 9:07:29 PM] ~ SRI DHARANI: Being good in all fields doesn't make sense but when you are best at one thing it will reach unbelievable height. 
They are following this strategy. Just giving the coffee in different flavours. People are more excited to taste their new coffee recipe than other stuffs. Like KFC they are focusing only on chicken right.
[09/09/23, 9:08:10 PM] ThiyagaB: Nice, good start.. but it needs more than that la to be successful
[09/09/23, 9:08:20 PM] ~ Lucky: they made mistakes in names written on the cups it gave them huge self advertisements.....they caught the mindset of people in finding the mistakes in others and it helped them take a opportunity to increase there sales
[09/09/23, 9:09:16 PM] ~ Fadhil: Yeah this is one of the key factor too
[09/09/23, 9:09:31 PM] ThiyagaB: Oh is this true?

[09/09/23, 9:24:25 PM] ~ Sonali✨: Starbucks allows you to customise your own drink , I’m not sure if Starbucks invented this trend but this seems like a very attractive and intriguing idea as people are able to experiment and come up with various drinks which are not part of their menu.They also have limited edition drinks during fall (Halloween),Christmas etc..
[09/09/23, 9:24:29 PM] ~ JOTHIRUBAN M: Real estate

And it's under the control of tata groups
[09/09/23, 9:38:39 PM] SHIVABALAN MANI🦂: starbucks is really a monster in business! their awesome strategies attract a tremendous  number of customers!

 one among the strategies is their store locations! they always place their stores in places where people gather in huge numbers. this attracts a large number of customers for them!

 their global expansion is also a factor! they have expanded their shop in more than 80 countries with 32000 branches! 

they've also mastered the art of updating the menu regularly! people will never get bored of visiting Starbucks because they give something new every time!

they have adopted customer loyalty programs too ! just like KFC has Wednesday offers they do have Starbucks rewards! once a customer enters their store then they'll definitely visit them again and again!✅

they never compromise with their quality! their consistent quality control have earned them huge respect and trust among consumers! this is the most important thing!


they have a strong presence in social media platform! they constantly engage with their customers and  trigger their customers!

and most importantly their store ambience is first class! their ambience , the music they play , each and every single thing attracts consumers to them! they make their shop a place where people can relax , work and even study . they have the perfect ambience! 

Starbucks is very well known for their seasonal offers! they have themed beverages during special occasions . they really make  huge amount in these times than usual days!


their constant investment to increase the unique customer experience is also a thing! they've invested in AI to understand the preference of customers and enhance the customer experience

 you need to undergo training to become a barista in starbucks! this is enough to tell how much customer satisfaction means to them! starbucks focuses majorly on customer satisfaction and that gets them more and more consumers 

all these factors gets them huge💰💰💰 ‎<This message was edited>

[09/09/23, 9:39:34 PM] ~ JOTHIRUBAN M: Not in here.

Europe and American continents.

Here in India I can't find Starbucks than metropolitan cities.

[09/09/23, 9:44:20 PM] ~ prasanth: Starbucks focused on 
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, and many other Asian, European, and Middle Eastern countries
These countries it's fascinating because these are all best economics country in the world 
And now, Starbucks has expanded they market into India and Italy especially in the major cities in India and Italy
[09/09/23, 9:45:00 PM] Koushik PEC: And Starbucks India is owned by tata i guess
[09/09/23, 9:45:37 PM] ~ prasanth: Yes

[09/09/23, 9:49:42 PM] ~ prasanth: Even though the Starbucks is owned by tata they focus on the major country with best economics well being as I mentioned above 
And now in India also 
These makes the Starbucks more profitable
And another facinating and intresting thing is it is owned by tata that is also a major reason for Starbucks more profitable

[09/09/23, 9:55:38 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw 50 yrs back, starbucks started with a simple strategy, 
Ppl hangout over coffee 
Like namma ooru tea kadai, ( all the recent tea shops like chai kings) 
So ppl came to shop just to hangout
[09/09/23, 9:56:20 PM] ThiyagaB: Adhuku mela they built apdiye as they grow, mainly by investing on loyalty
[09/09/23, 9:57:00 PM] ThiyagaB: This tea or coffee always have some emotions attached to it… 
They used it really well along with lots of business innovations

[09/09/23, 10:01:01 PM] Koushik PEC: Something like codesapians to us
[09/09/23, 10:02:07 PM] ~ prasanth: More focus and concentration on tea

[09/09/23, 10:04:32 PM] ~ ^_^: This is how life is guys....from Starbucks to Tata (Big Fan) then Starbucks raid to Tea kadai...and ippo samosa....being concise and covering the sequel of this story in a nutshell we have come to an end of today's Convo... Starbucks knows how to attract people as it was a total different concept of writing names on the cups we throw after use...but people used it as a fashion symbol to show how their names are carved and beautifully written in a normal cup...So The moral is even if u buy a new pen, many start with writing their names...that's how life is...make sure your name is known to everyone either by taking snaps of coffee cups or being casted in a television...                     Thanking you
                   Yours truthfully

[10/09/23, 12:40:58 PM] ThiyagaB: @918015227849  Thanks once again man..    especially when you have your kid's birthday, you still spent time for the session.
The session is detailed and touched the basics, should be helpful for students who felt lost with big jargons.

Ppl,
As we mentioned earlier, our target audience are those who struggle to cope up with the speed at which the lessons are taught in college, or students who feels, programming is hard. 
Please keep your feedback coming to us, it helps to tune our sessions better.

The next DSA class will cover the complex topics of Algorithms, Non-Linear Data structure, and we will also share some exercises to try in home
[10/09/23, 12:47:30 PM] ThiyagaB: *Statistics :*
I am always proud about myself on how i understand students, especially the group psychology.    
When myself and vinith wanted to have just 25 ppl as audience for the session.   We worked out the numbers and it ended up exactly the same :)

we expected,  
100+ will do the assessment  out of 700+. -
and only 1/3 of the selected ppl will attend, so we sent to 75 ppl and as expected we had 25..  adhu epdi avlo exacta vandhuchu therla..
[10/09/23, 12:48:26 PM] ThiyagaB: adhuvum oruthana thedittu irukken..  invite varlaina Strike panvom, Tyre koluthuvom  nu scene pottu irundhan group la..  aalaye kaanum :)

Today we are gonna be having a simple quiz
[11/09/23, 9:01:22 PM] ~ Ms😎: What is return to scale
[11/09/23, 9:01:28 PM] Koushik PEC: ‎This message was deleted.

[11/09/23, 9:02:53 PM] ~ Justin: 14 bro
[11/09/23, 9:02:56 PM] ~ prasanth: 14
[11/09/23, 9:03:03 PM] Koushik PEC: Explanation??
[11/09/23, 9:03:06 PM] ~ karthick: 14 cm
[11/09/23, 9:03:09 PM] ~ Justin: x+4y=34;x+y=19
[11/09/23, 9:03:13 PM] ~ Justin: so 3y=15
[11/09/23, 9:03:17 PM] ~ Justin: so y=5
[11/09/23, 9:03:20 PM] ~ Justin: x+y=19
[11/09/23, 9:03:22 PM] ~ Justin: x=14
‎[11/09/23, 9:03:22 PM] ~ Santhosh: ‎image omitted
[11/09/23, 9:03:38 PM] Koushik PEC: What is x? what is y?
[11/09/23, 9:03:52 PM] ~ Santhosh: X is height of  one glass
[11/09/23, 9:04:11 PM] ~ Justin: x is the glass and y is the small glass
[11/09/23, 9:04:20 PM] ~ Santhosh: Y is height of succesive glasses other than 1st glass
[11/09/23, 9:04:30 PM] ~ Heshinth: x+4y=34
x+y=19
Solving the 2 equations
x=14 ,y=5
 So the height of the glass is 14 cm
[11/09/23, 9:04:48 PM] ~ Lavanya.I: ‎This message was deleted.
[11/09/23, 9:04:49 PM] ~ Shunmathi: 1) 14+5+5+5+5=34
2) 14+5=19
3) 14
[11/09/23, 9:05:13 PM] ~ prasanth: Each upper glasses is consist of 5cm at last class it reduced to one glass so the height is 14 cm
[11/09/23, 9:05:31 PM] ~ Chokkalingam 💛: x is height of one glass
y is height of the top of the glass ( remaining part after getting inside to one cup)

x+ 1*y= 19
x + 4*y=34 

by solving 
x=14 and y=5
[11/09/23, 9:05:44 PM] ~ Chokkalingam 💛: !
[11/09/23, 9:07:41 PM] Koushik PEC: Others???
[11/09/23, 9:16:30 PM] ~ ...Krishnan....🤭...D..: I)Total height of the 5 glass 34 cm,
2)2 glass height 19 cm ,
3)By subtracting this we get the 3 top small portion height as 15 cm 
4)for one top portion of the glass be 5 cm 
5)then 19 - 5 = 14 cm
[11/09/23, 9:18:38 PM] Koushik PEC: Ok we intentionally made this an easy one , actually we are having an part two today :)
[11/09/23, 9:19:34 PM] ~ Gautham: 14
[11/09/23, 9:20:27 PM] Koushik PEC: Anyways the winner of today's quiz is @919500002612 as he answered first with Valid explanation :) good try guys.

Reward: 20₹ 🎉🎉
[11/09/23, 9:21:03 PM] ThiyagaB: 👏🏾👏🏾
[11/09/23, 9:21:07 PM] ~ Justin: 😄Thanks @919500144487 ✌️
[11/09/23, 9:23:29 PM] Koushik PEC: let's move to the second part of today's quiz :

There is a 10-year-old kid who found the word 'hyper-threading' in a processor's description. How do you explain the concept of threading to a 10-year-old?
[11/09/23, 9:23:58 PM] ThiyagaB: Oh appo adhu trial ah :)
[11/09/23, 9:25:24 PM] Koushik PEC: Hope u recieved ur reward :)
[11/09/23, 9:26:10 PM] ~ Justin: thambi inga paaru da "hyper threading" ku oru example oda solraen,  onnoda toys la nee mattum eduthu vacha mudika time aagum, naalu peru sernthu panna seekram panlaa, so andha maari computer la threads irukum oru thread kitta ella vela kudutha time aagum, ella threadum panna seekram mudichaarllam. purinjudha da :)
[11/09/23, 9:26:10 PM] ~ Gautham: Imagine a processor is like a chef in a kitchen, and it has to cook multiple dishes at once. Threading is like the chef having more than one pair of hands, so they can work on different dishes at the same time. It makes the cooking process faster and more efficient. Hyper-threading is like giving the chef even more pairs of hands, so they can do even more things at once, making the cooking (or processing) even faster
[11/09/23, 9:26:32 PM] ~ Justin: namma thambi ku tamil theriyum nu nambuvom ;)
[11/09/23, 9:26:48 PM] Koushik PEC: Yeah ofcourse
[11/09/23, 9:26:50 PM] ~ prasanth: Hyper threading is a Intel's technology
It is an hardware, in which each core in hardware is run on one thread
[11/09/23, 9:27:07 PM] ~ Justin: thanks bro ✌️
[11/09/23, 9:27:28 PM] Koushik PEC: 10 year old doesn't know what's Intel or hardware
[11/09/23, 9:27:44 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: If two different customers order two different drinks at the same time, a waiter (metaphor for a single cpu core) can bring both of the them in one trip cause that waiter has two hands (a single core acts as two logical cores). So in normal circumstances the waiter would have only brought one drink at a time but by utilising the other hand that is idle, he cut the execution time for that process significantly
[11/09/23, 9:28:00 PM] ~ prasanth: Yeah!
[11/09/23, 9:28:04 PM] ThiyagaB: Avanunga, 
AMD
Apple M2 
ellam pesranunga ippo
[11/09/23, 9:28:23 PM] ~ prasanth: That's right sir and true
[11/09/23, 9:28:47 PM] Koushik PEC: Atleast when I was a 10 year old 😂
[11/09/23, 9:29:41 PM] ~ Chokkalingam 💛: Lets take a example of having toy car In hand
Assume you are having 1 car
You can hold it in 1 hand
What if u got 2 toy car
U would hold it in 2 hands 
Each one in one hand...

Even you own both the toy car
U r representing it showing it as
Each car in each hand

Exactly how this works..
When a computer is assigned with multiple tasks
Each task is represented as thread
Thread would look like thin small peice of whole cloth

As a saree is made of every thread in it
A process a task is made up of every small process called thread

Example you are watching a video in yt
The audio function
The command writing function
Everything is small process called thread 
Combined to work as efficienctly
[11/09/23, 9:30:29 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: Imagine that the kid has to draw using one hand and wants to eat snack at the same time. So the kid can draw using one hand while having snacks using the other hand. So here, the brain performs 2 different tasks at the same time and thus enables the kid to do multitasking which is similar to the hyper threading process in computer's memory and thus the efficiency of the work gets increased.
[11/09/23, 9:32:13 PM] ~ Lokesh Kumar S: ‎~ Lokesh Kumar S left
[11/09/23, 9:32:43 PM] ~ prasanth: Oka let's make simple, about hyper threading 
Instead of giving large work force to single Intel core processor thread use to solit the work into different threads 
These thread are processed in CPU core 
Use to save time
[11/09/23, 9:33:04 PM] Koushik PEC: Actual hyper-threading concept introduces logical cores right how do u guys explain that??
[11/09/23, 9:35:40 PM] ~ Justin: do you mean virtual cores bro?
[11/09/23, 9:35:49 PM] Koushik PEC: Yeah
[11/09/23, 9:36:27 PM] Koushik PEC: How physical cores are different from logical cores ?
[11/09/23, 9:37:18 PM] ~ Justin: so thambi inga paru, "physical core" na onaku naalu peru iruakaanga naalu task panna;
[11/09/23, 9:37:47 PM] ~ Justin: "virtual core" na onaku naalu task at a time panna sollli onaku mattum sollirkaanga, on moolaiya vachu nee naalathaiyum pannum

[11/09/23, 9:39:58 PM] ~ prasanth: The logical core is how many core are divided for multithreading to allow multiple instruction to processor on each core 
The physical core is a core on CPU

So we are discussing about processors what do think of this man comparing IC and microprocessors on a same scale
[11/09/23, 9:57:10 PM] Koushik PEC: Where their use cases are different
[11/09/23, 10:07:17 PM] ~ Justin: ICs are just microchips just electronic components which are put together to do carry out certain tasks, but ICs are general. They can be anything just a bunch of logic gates. But Microprocessors are tailor made to do one thing, to excecute tasks on a large scale, to get input and process them and produce finite and deterministic output. Microprocessors are niche and specialised products of ICs which encompass larger variety of products
[11/09/23, 10:09:06 PM] Koushik PEC: Just opinion tha bro keten :)
[11/09/23, 10:09:54 PM] ~ Justin: ECE student ah irundhukutu explain panlaana adhu oru kola kuttham bro 😵 ✌️✌️😁

[12/09/23, 9:03:28 PM] ~ ^_^: Just a general open-ended question today
[12/09/23, 9:03:43 PM] ~ ^_^: Nowadays People either focus on their final CGPA or focus on their Educational knowledge....what are ur thoughts on them?... whether we should study for marks or study to gain experience and build up our skills.
[12/09/23, 9:04:10 PM] ~ Justin: Skills>Cgpa
[12/09/23, 9:04:11 PM] ~ Justin: .
[12/09/23, 9:04:32 PM] ~ ^_^: Woahhhh! Good one
[12/09/23, 9:04:44 PM] ~ ^_^: But what abt the criteria we have in our colleges?
[12/09/23, 9:04:52 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Balance both...since they still consider CGPA as a criteria during placements..
[12/09/23, 9:05:03 PM] Koushik PEC: But placement eligibility says minimum gpa = 8 ,8.5 etc
[12/09/23, 9:05:23 PM] ~ 👾: Skills matter a lot more than CGPA
CGPA is just for placement

But both plays a major role
[12/09/23, 9:05:31 PM] ~ Justin: say bye to placements and get off placements if your skilled that is
[12/09/23, 9:05:45 PM] ThiyagaB: offcampus placements avlo easya
[12/09/23, 9:05:53 PM] ~ Regular Guy: should study to gain experience and build up our skills but at the same time cgpa play a key roll in placements

[12/09/23, 9:14:06 PM] Koushik PEC: Is there other scales to decide a person has skill without gpa??
[12/09/23, 9:14:32 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: But everything takes time la
Financially afford or strong ah iruntha  practically we can take risks
[12/09/23, 9:15:52 PM] Koushik PEC: Far better risk than choosing clgs 💀
[12/09/23, 9:17:00 PM] ~ Regular Guy: maybe if he won any recognizable hackathons and did my projects

[12/09/23, 9:19:00 PM] ~ prasanth: Once we showcase our talent and deep knowledge in skills like participating in different competition conducted by various companies. 
Not winning in all competition but participating and gaining knowledge is some what good 
Thats is the different scale that many companies are seeing rather than Gpa
[12/09/23, 9:19:26 PM] ThiyagaB: how do we showcase, adhuku first shortlist aaganum la

[12/09/23, 9:22:33 PM] ThiyagaB: you are all right.. ofcourse ur true knowledge only matters, 
even if u get placed with only GPA, u cant sustain in industry with that attitude.

But on the other hand,  there is always a huge crowd everywhere, so to stand out, GPA is one easy ways companies choose
[12/09/23, 9:23:50 PM] Koushik PEC: So how do guys search for an offcampus oppertunity???
[12/09/23, 9:24:01 PM] ~ prasanth: Competition heavy in off campus but if your skills are mind blowing then it is easy you can beat the other 75% competitors

[12/09/23, 9:44:56 PM] ThiyagaB: yess from ur discussions one of the point which i saw is , 
1. how a fresher will showcase his skills, what are the ways to show his skills other than GPA..  platform should solve this
2. then based on that showcase, how it helps recruiters too.

Rendume already iruku.. but what is missing, what we can do nu we can brainstorm

[13/09/23, 8:59:31 PM] ThiyagaB: Dear Ppl, 
Most of the new joiners to this group may be clueless on the objective of the group, 
I request you all to check the description once.. 
it’s one of a kind community where we strive to help students in every way possible.. 
and recently we even started to drive this group by students themselves.
where every week one college will manage. 
PEC folks done a great job in the first week, from tomorrow RMD will take over. 

I also understand, few of you feel the msgs are overwhelming and difficult to follow, ( few ppl even left, ennada pesreenga nu :) ) 
So from now, we will try to use the “Announcements” section better to share info and use this mostly for discussions. 
With announcements you will get the right info without much clutter. 
Hope it helps everyone with better clarity. 

Also please note, from Day 1, the community is at its best in not spamming the group, and we will be active only during 9-10. 
Any suggestions always welcome. DM me. 
Enjoy ‎<This message was edited>
[13/09/23, 9:02:27 PM] ThiyagaB: “Announcements” can be found in “community “ 
I also posted one useful link there to start with
[13/09/23, 9:03:13 PM] ThiyagaB: Back to our usual day’s activity, 
PEC folks the stage is all yours
[13/09/23, 9:03:32 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Sure sir
[13/09/23, 9:03:53 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Now it's the last quiz day from PEC team🫡
[13/09/23, 9:05:24 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: So today's quiz is
You have two jugs, one that can hold 5 liters of water and another that can hold 3 liters. How can you measure exactly 4 liters of water using these two jugs, an unlimited supply of water, and without wasting any water in the process?

Think well and send your answers!!
[13/09/23, 9:08:13 PM] ~ Sheegan Sri 👻: ‎This message was deleted.
[13/09/23, 9:08:13 PM] ~ Sanjith: First we gotta fill the 5l bottle and pour it fully to 3l bottle.. that wil retain 2l in the 5l bottle. Pour off the 3l bottle of water and use it to store 2l in the 3l bottle.. now again refill the 5l bottle. Now 3l bottle has 2l water and 1l space. Pour water from 5l bottle into the 3l bottle that would fill the 3l bottle by taking in exactly 1l of water, leaving back 4l of water.
[13/09/23, 9:09:23 PM] ~ CR7 GAMING YT - தமிழ்: Start with both jugs empty.
Fill the 3-liter jug to the top.
Pour the water from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. Now, the 3-liter jug is empty, and the 5-liter jug has 3 liters of water in it.
Fill the 3-liter jug to the top again.
Carefully pour the water from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug until the 5-liter jug is full. This will leave you with exactly 1 liter of water in the 3-liter jug.
Now, empty the 5-liter jug completely.
Pour the 1 liter of water from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug.
Finally, fill the 3-liter jug to the top and pour it into the 5-liter jug. This will fill the 5-liter jug to its maximum capacity, leaving you with exactly 4 liters of water in the 5-liter jug.
[13/09/23, 9:10:44 PM] ~ Kavindar: Fill 5 litre bottel
5 litre to 3 litre
5(2L) -> container
3L -> 5L
fill -> 5L
5L -> 3L
5L(2L) - container(2L)
now container have 4L

[13/09/23, 9:18:35 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Measurement pakanum la
[13/09/23, 9:22:01 PM] ~ Santhosh: Use 3l water jug and fill it with water anx pour this content in the jar where u want to have ur 4l
Then fill 3l water jug and pour it in 5l twice , while doing 2nd time 1l can't be shifted from 3l jug to 5l jug
That 1l can be poured where u need to have 4l which already has 3l
So finally 3+1 -->4L
[13/09/23, 9:23:47 PM] ~ JOHN YUGANDHAR: Fill the 5-liter jug with water.
Pour the water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.
The 5-liter jug will now have 2 liters of water left.
Empty the 3-liter jug.
Pour the 2 liters of water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug.
Fill the 5-liter jug again with water.
Carefully pour water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.
The 5-liter jug will now have 4 liters of water.
[13/09/23, 9:23:49 PM] ~ Tharun Karthick T: Fill the 5-liter jug with water.
Pour the water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.

Empty the 3-liter jug.
Pour the 2 liters of water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug.
Fill the 5-liter jug again with water.
Carefully pour water from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full.

You shouldn't pour the water waste ah
That water should go to the other bottle only 
You can refill the bottles though
[13/09/23, 9:28:07 PM] ~ Sheegan Sri 👻: first fill the 3l of water in 3l jug then pour it into the 5l jar now we have 3l jar empty and 5l jar with 3l of water(2l of empty) then again fill the 3l jar (actually our 3l jar had already measured 3l of water ) now and pour it into the 5l jar util it was filled now we jar 1l of water in 3l jar so that 3l jar would have 1l water remaining , as per the question given we just have to measure 4l of water not to get 4l of water in any of the jar so already 3l now 1l (remaining in the jar) totally 4l was measure
[13/09/23, 9:29:00 PM] ~ Tharun Karthick T: maybe, you can Ask another question ma'am
[13/09/23, 9:29:38 PM] ~ ^_^: Just a random but interesting one....why don't we have a same coloured heart or any other emoji for our grp??
[13/09/23, 9:29:39 PM] ~ Jayachandran✨: First, empty the 3l bowl, and transfer the 2l from the 5l bowl into it... Now fill the 5l bowl again, then pour water carefully from the 5l bowl into the 3l bowl until it is full - exactly one more liter... The 5lbowl now has exactly 4 liters.
[13/09/23, 9:29:52 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Most random ever

[13/09/23, 9:33:10 PM] ~ VIGNESHWARAN: filling the both the jugs by half and adding it only possible way. Even we are using additional storage the remaining water in the 3L OR 5L jug will be wasted
[13/09/23, 9:33:30 PM] ~ Me: first fill the first jar exactly half(2.5l) pour this into the 3l jar untill it reaches 1.5 l(exactly half) now you have 1 l in 5l jar and 1.5 l in 3l jar now fill 3l jar fully and pour it into 5 liter jar you have 4 l in 5l jar :)

[13/09/23, 9:56:23 PM] ~ Shandhini Mohankumar: Fill the 3-liter jug to the top.
Pour the water from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. This leaves you with 2 liters of water in the 3-liter jug.
Now, fill the 3-liter jug to the top again.
Carefully pour the water from the 3-liter jug into the 5-liter jug. Since there were already 2 liters in the 5-liter jug, you can only add 1 more liter from the 3-liter jug, leaving you with 4 liters of water in the 5-liter jug.
Now you have precisely 4 liters of water in the 5-liter jug, measured using the 3-liter and 5-liter jugs.

I have little announcement on what we planned for the group in next few weeks,

1.  We heard you, got your feedback and @918015227849  will try to cover indepth with handson coding samples on DSA

2. Idea Brainstorming session,  will do this after i come back from vacation.  This is one of my fav part, and cant wait to see how we get together to give shape to a raw idea. 

3. As our community grow bigger , We will set a 'Refresh'  day every week, where we will open a window, remove the restrictions, so  you can add your interested friends.  Also during refresh day, we can let ppl leave the group too :) 

Also i will be sharing a 'Anonymous' feedback form in 'Announcements',  where you can add whats your expectations, what you like, and what you want to improve in this group, please spend 30 secs to share ur thoughts to improve together. ‎<This message was edited>

[16/09/23, 9:06:33 PM] ~ ~TheDiablo😈~: Yeah bro😂
[16/09/23, 9:06:48 PM] ~ Aakash: THE PROBLEM STEPS :

1. Let's denote the daughter's current age as `D` and the mother's current age as M.
2. From the problem, we know that the sum of their ages is 56. So, we can write this as an equation: D + M = 56.
3. We also know that in four years, the mother's age will be three times the daughter's age. So, we can write another equation: M + 4 = 3 * (D + 4).
4. Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it.

By solving these equations, we find that the daughter is 12 years old and the mother is 44 years old.

[16/09/23, 9:11:30 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Now the nxt q

Added some complexity 

But time limit is same

Present ages of Sameer and Anand are in the ratio of 5 : 4 respectively. Three years hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11 : 9 respectively. What is Anand's present age in years?
[16/09/23, 9:11:54 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: @918838030424 now u can try

[16/09/23, 9:14:47 PM] ~ Mano Ranjitham 💛: (5x + 3) / (4x + 3) = 11/9
9(5x + 3) = 11(4x + 3)
45x + 27 = 44x + 33
45x - 44x + 27 = 33
x + 27 = 33
x = 6
4x = 4×6=24
Answer 24
[16/09/23, 9:14:51 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: All are using "bro".. can't differentiate
[16/09/23, 9:14:55 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Girl or boy

[16/09/23, 9:17:48 PM] ~ Sam🥰: 🥰
[16/09/23, 9:17:49 PM] Koushik PEC: 3 years difference la 😅
[16/09/23, 9:17:57 PM] ~ Aakash: 1. Let's denote the present ages of Sameer and Anand as 5x and 4x respectively.
2. According to the problem, three years from now, the ratio of their ages will be 11:9. So, we can write this as an equation: 5x + 3 = 11/9 * (4x + 3).
3. Solving this equation, we find that x = 6.
4. Therefore, Anand's present age is 4x = 4*6 = 24 years.

[17/09/23, 11:18:46 AM] ThiyagaB: Good morning ppl, 

I am meeting few of the Volunteers in 10 mins at 11:30, 
It’s a casual ‘meet and greet’ 

Interested can join here  at 11:30,

https://meet.google.com/ctc-wveq-kzh
[17/09/23, 12:38:07 PM] ThiyagaB: It was a super refresher today morning... thanks for all who joined and great inputs..    Ennada ellam over matured and business ppl maadhiri pesureenga..  chinna pasanga kitta pesra maadhiriye illa..    
I will share our Meeting minutes soon..
[17/09/23, 12:49:02 PM] ThiyagaB: Meeting Minutes:
*Engagement*:
1. Separate Group to interact for 'Projects' 'hackthons' , for guide and directions
2. Idea brainstorming
3.  Weekly random topics to identify new talents in group
4.  Try to reduce no. of msgs in group and plan to take the load off whatsapp
5.   Listed Value to Students, Knowledge, fun, projects, internships, realtime workshops
6.   Students will self drive community by taking sessions, new events 

*Build Community website*

1. This is still in ideation stage, but the idea is to create a portal to help students build their profile step by step with guidance for projects, courses, internship, etc..
2. Give Incentives to students who create value to community and themselves
[17/09/23, 3:15:06 PM] ThiyagaB: Good Evening ppl, 

*Weekly “Refresh” *

The community may not be relevant to few, might get added  here by their friends, with all due respect please feel free to *leave this group*,

You can still be part of “announcements” to subscribe to only important msgs

[17/09/23, 9:45:42 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Hey ppl!!!! So today's activity is all about gaining some knowledge on new terms related to DSA and Programming....
So you guys have 15 minutes to go!!!
*Define a new term related to DSA*
[17/09/23, 9:48:33 PM] Koushik PEC: Heap data structure - Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is. always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes
[17/09/23, 9:51:14 PM] ~ Fadhil: Stack - it allows you to perform operations from one end only, like when you insert and remove new books from the top.
[17/09/23, 9:51:34 PM] ~ Fadhil: Eg. Deck of cards
[17/09/23, 9:51:50 PM] ~ Fadhil: Not be a new term 🌚

[17/09/23, 9:55:47 PM] ~ VIGNESHWARAN: A maze path refers to finding a way through a complex, puzzle-like structure known as a maze. It's like solving a labyrinth or a puzzle where you start at one point and aim to reach another while navigating through a network of walls or obstacles. This task involves using various strategies or algorithms, like trying different paths, marking visited areas, and backtracking, to ultimately find a route from the starting point to the destination, which might not be obvious at first glance. Maze path-solving is a common problem in computer science and puzzles, often used to demonstrate and practice problem-solving techniques and algorithms.

It is used in 

-representation
-efficient exploration of elements
-memory optimisation
-finding paths

In essence, data structures provide the framework for algorithms to process and make sense of maze data, ultimately helping you navigate from the entrance to the exit efficiently. They are fundamental tools in computer science and enable solutions to a wide range of problems, not just maze pathfinding.

[18/09/23, 8:09:31 PM] ~ Narendran.G: Ok sir.
[18/09/23, 8:15:15 PM] ThiyagaB: This guy nailed it..    

In programming world, every type of challenge demands a specific style, 
for e.g. when you develop a server side enterprise application, u should follow frameworks, coding standards, neat code
when u develop a utility, you have to make sure, you write in least number of lines possible. 
when we develop user facing application, make sure, the statements are easy to understand from user.

Thiru used Single line filter function with for and if, and also used [::-1] to simply reverse the list,  
Ivan code adikira style la parthale, ratham partha payala theriyuran..  pala vela pannirupan pola..

The others also did great,  few special mentions, 
@919445264572 :  Indha chinna vayasula ivlo detail coding aah .   :) 
@918838030424   I also like how she focuses on details, look at the statements, hint la koduthu..  
Ravindar :  followed similar filter approach
@917871204433  @919500144487  did simple and neat approach.
praveen, pranesh all took conventional approaches.. 

Very good overall.

But personally i love a concise coding, using the power of language, and Thiru got it utilizing python's inbuilt functions and also he did first ( Question paper leak aagiducha .. 🤔 )

[18/09/23, 8:24:13 PM] ~ Thirumurugan A: Not really broo , as per now learning only , python I am used to
[18/09/23, 8:24:14 PM] ~ Thirumurugan A: 2-3 years
[18/09/23, 8:24:38 PM] ThiyagaB: Valid argument dhan.  i accept it.. the power of python is in its simplicity, and cant be expected in c or java
[18/09/23, 8:25:48 PM] ThiyagaB: and Narendar, you can also argue with me, so proper coding standards la code adikradhu vs concise and less lines la code adikradhu.. which is better
[18/09/23, 8:28:31 PM] ~ Narendran.G: if a company asks us to code a project in less lines and the options are C,C++,Java,R
[18/09/23, 8:28:41 PM] ~ Narendran.G: what can we do sir then
[18/09/23, 8:28:50 PM] ThiyagaB: thats why i gave this explanation..
[18/09/23, 8:29:31 PM] ~ Narendran.G: hmm ok sir🥲
[18/09/23, 8:29:44 PM] ThiyagaB: yes i am about to answer this, 

In a coding interview,  if they say any language

Python is always easy and better, also the interviewer will love it, when u use the power of language instead of writing everything on your own.
[18/09/23, 8:30:12 PM] ThiyagaB: you did well dhanda..  nee la enterprise level code adika vendiya aalu.. idhu simple test coding dhana :)
[18/09/23, 8:33:58 PM] ~ Narendran.G: my only fear is if they ask other than python ,code this problem in interview means sir
[18/09/23, 8:34:49 PM] ThiyagaB: if they ask other language, it means you have that language mentioned in ur resume..   if u r scared.. then remove than language from ur resume :)
[18/09/23, 8:36:43 PM] ThiyagaB: Ok based on today's mini test, i guess the group demands more than this,  we will come with up with an idea of "micro hackathon"  with some interesting problem statement next month..
[18/09/23, 8:39:26 PM] ThiyagaB: Btw today's winner @919445150282 's profile is interesting..  check it out

[18/09/23, 8:43:59 PM] ~ Thirumurugan A: The idea of using notion for portfolio is mainly because of my college cause my college continuously providing works in which i don't really have time make a portfolio with reactjs or three.js i was planning one with that , but a fine day came to know about notion , so made a temporary portfolio one that ; )

So before going into today's quiz....Let’s have a warmup session 😅
So let me ask u all a question..
what do you know about Docker and Kubernetes?
[20/09/23, 8:45:54 PM] ~ ^_^: What is docker and kubernetes?
[20/09/23, 8:46:26 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: that was the q bro🥲

[20/09/23, 8:52:05 PM] ~ Harish.EA: Same ques❓
[20/09/23, 8:52:11 PM] Koushik PEC: Docker helps to create os level virtualisation with containers
[20/09/23, 8:52:33 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Docker is used to distribute applications independent of the platform. Instead of emulating a virtual machine, docker would simply combine the source code and all its dependencies into a single container making it easier to deploy.

Kubernetes is used to manage and distribute docker containers
[20/09/23, 8:52:58 PM] ~ 👩🏻‍🎓Sree👩🏻‍🎓: Docker is a container runtime, Kubernetes is a platform for running and managing containers from many container runtimes.
[20/09/23, 8:53:14 PM] Koushik PEC: Helps to easily setup projects independent of the environment
[20/09/23, 8:53:24 PM] ~ Dharshuu: on point explanation...grt!!
[20/09/23, 8:57:54 PM] ThiyagaB: When we want to run the code, java or python,
You need to install those runtimes( jre, python) 
If it has database you need to setup db too. 

So when we want to run in different machine, we have to install and setup all these again. 
Docker removes this, and makes our life easy. It’s like container including our code, the runtime, and other dependencies.

[20/09/23, 9:01:11 PM] ~ Dharshuu: We had some great responses....though a simple sort of explanation here...
*Docker and Kubernetes*
Basically, Docker and Kubernetes are one of the most popular DevOps tools.
In simple words, Docker is a container where you can run your application without worrying about hardware and operating system versions, which makes it easy to spin off a new environment without worrying about config details.
And..
Kubernetes is that manages your container effectively.Kubernetes is the most crucial container management technology in the world and is used a lot in a real production environment where you have many containers to manage.
[20/09/23, 9:03:55 PM] ThiyagaB: Nice... one bonus trivia..  
Those who feel programming eh enaku varala nu, 
There is a role in IT called 'DevOps' or 'Infra', a knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes will help you get the job, the role will have less programming and more of administration and setup.
[20/09/23, 9:04:51 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Ohh...Great sir...we will start to learn more abt it!!..
[20/09/23, 9:11:19 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: Alright!!!.....now we've covered some basics about docker and kubernetes I guess.....so let's jump into a little quiz.

"What are the key differences between docker and kubernetes?"
[20/09/23, 9:12:18 PM] Koushik PEC: Docker is the container and kubernetes is the platform to manage them
[20/09/23, 9:13:41 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: You can do some digging about it....just to know things that you never heard of.
[20/09/23, 9:15:08 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: Wow✨......short n sweet
[20/09/23, 9:20:15 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Kubernetes auto deploy "clusters" and makes the docker containers scalable.
[20/09/23, 9:20:48 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: Super bro
[20/09/23, 9:26:26 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Guys...no more replies?!!....do share your thoughts here!!!we can learn more on it if everyone participates!!!waiting for some more responses.. :)

[20/09/23, 9:33:47 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Hmm... if the question is out of topic, it must be our attitude to make us search for the solution.

I am sharing some related document on Docker and Kubernetes.
Don't be afraid to explore guys
[20/09/23, 9:33:55 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: "What are the main differences between the Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?
Docker Swarm is Docker’s native, open-source container orchestration platform that is used to cluster and schedule Docker containers. Swarm differs from Kubernetes in the following ways:

Docker Swarm is more convenient to set up but doesn’t have a robust cluster, while Kubernetes is more complicated to set up but the benefit of having the assurance of a robust cluster
Docker Swarm can’t do auto-scaling (as can Kubernetes); however, Docker scaling is five times faster than Kubernetes 
Docker Swarm doesn’t have a GUI; Kubernetes has a GUI in the form of a dashboard 
Docker Swarm does automatic load balancing of traffic between containers in a cluster, while Kubernetes requires manual intervention for load balancing such traffic  
Docker requires third-party tools like ELK stack for logging and monitoring, while Kubernetes has integrated tools for the same 
Docker Swarm can share storage volumes with any container easily, while Kubernetes can only share storage volumes with containers in the same pod
Docker can deploy rolling updates but can’t deploy automatic rollbacks; Kubernetes can deploy rolling updates as well as automatic rollbacks"
 https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/kubernetes-tutorial/kubernetes-interview-questions#:~:text=What%20are%20the,as%20automatic%20rollbacks
[20/09/23, 9:37:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Second year la ye interview preparation ah.  

For second years, just a high level info on what is docker or kubernetes will  help when you are building your projects.  So andha alavuku therinjale podhum..   actually programming vida, docker la romba sappa matter..
[20/09/23, 9:38:50 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: It a kutty course on the topic suggest by our placement cell.

[20/09/23, 9:39:53 PM] ThiyagaB: yes.. ppl can just skim thru this..  it helps when they dive deep into real projects in upcoming years.

[21/09/23, 9:01:10 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: Hi guys, today I am putting forward a bit controversial and debatable topic.
So, everyone is allowed to share their own thoughts about how we can examine this scenario.

The question of whether governments should have the ability to access encrypted communications for national security purposes is a complex and highly debated topic. It involves a delicate balance between individual privacy rights and the need to protect national security interests.
This could involve listening to individuals calls and their messages, tracking their daily activities ect...
[21/09/23, 9:03:27 PM] ThiyagaB: Wow this boils down to
Right vs Left politic views. 
It’s an interesting debate, i am eager to see if students have a view on these kinda topics…
[21/09/23, 9:04:00 PM] ~ Sivaneshwaran: ‎~ Sivaneshwaran left
[21/09/23, 9:04:30 PM] ~ ~srivaigunth~: It’s not a question of “if” governments will have access to private data. That access is already rampant. Even if companies do not build backdoors, governments will find other methods to monitor data in the name of national security. There is always a potential soft spot in the transmission of data, even if its encrypted🚶🏻‍♂️...
[21/09/23, 9:04:45 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: NSA already does this I believe. Dan Brown has an entire book revolving around this named digital fortress
[21/09/23, 9:08:35 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: ok, but seeking for ppl opinions around

[21/09/23, 9:39:52 PM] ~ 🗿: Selling your personal user data to ad agencies so that they can profile you and hence target you better to consume and purchase their products seems innocent only on the surface. They won't just stop at selling data to ad agencies though, with corporations as big as that, they have other interests, few aligned with our interests as users
[21/09/23, 9:40:17 PM] ~ ㅤ: Add whatsapp aswell . check your backup settings , they back up the chat without encrypting it so they can read it ‎<This message was edited>
[21/09/23, 9:40:18 PM] ~ Sanjith: Practically speaking, when there is access to all calls,messages by government, its always possible for the officials to exploit the common people for their benefits.


So in my opinion, the data needs to be restricted strictly to automated softwares that do not harbour any human biases.. this way both privacy can be protected as well as safety ensured👍

[21/09/23, 9:44:53 PM] ~ ㅤ: Just because i said i like dogs i dont want my instagram to be full of dog ads
[21/09/23, 9:45:20 PM] ~ 🗿: As in even if we only look at something like our data being sold off at ad agencies, ignoring everything else, it is very problematic. Our personal information, from what we search, say or do are being given off to create ads that target us better. You're profiled to know exactly what you will consume, what you will buy , view and use, or drive you into things they are confident you can buy and consume, maximizing your usage of their services, etc, all in a mad pursuit to maximize their gains at the expense of our data

Sure, it might not seem bad at first glance, but the more we think about it, the less 'innocent' it seems

[21/09/23, 9:50:58 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: It is not in everycase, u cant allow criminals to use whtts app la
then the organization will also be a part of crime for allowing them to do so
[21/09/23, 9:51:38 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: You give consent by agreeing to tos
[21/09/23, 9:51:50 PM] ~ ㅤ: So they dont have the right to privacy ?
[21/09/23, 9:51:55 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: so when it is questionable, it becomes their resposibility to moniter the safety on their platform
[21/09/23, 9:52:13 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: No.. nvr
criminal??? privacy ahhh????
[21/09/23, 9:52:49 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: constitution is for ppl who obey law bro, not for ones who break it

[21/09/23, 9:54:34 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: so u suggest tht criminals shd be given privacy to mind their business?
[21/09/23, 9:55:16 PM] ~ ㅤ: Yes unless there is a search warrant
[21/09/23, 9:55:27 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: I meant that about personalized data collection, not that they read our messages
[21/09/23, 9:55:34 PM] ~ Salai Kowshikan: Privacy is a basic human right
[21/09/23, 9:56:29 PM] ~ 🗿: It is a thin line to walk though, allowing the government access to anything and everything won't end well. Sure, if a government is benevolent and have our best interests in their minds, it is alright (in theory). Many governments rarely ever are though 🤣

If it was a super authoritarian nation that cuts down on ANY dissent or criticism we make of them for example, they will silence anyone who criticizes them
[21/09/23, 9:56:38 PM] ~ ㅤ: Law says you shouldn't kill people , so just because a kid downloaded a song illegally you classify him as criminal  , revoke his rights and kill him?
[21/09/23, 9:57:46 PM] ~ 🗿: But there has to be some basic degree of monitoring to clamp down on things that cross the line
[21/09/23, 9:58:31 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: So if a criminal is doing a drug dealing on whtts app, which is ridiculus.
If the META is promissing end to end encryption
Tmr if something happens, wont whtts app be blamed too??
[21/09/23, 9:58:48 PM] ~ ㅤ: Its not about that , its about about the fact that they have access to it
[21/09/23, 9:59:16 PM] ~ ㅤ: No and this has happened i think
[21/09/23, 9:59:36 PM] Koushik PEC: So what do u think they are gonna do with that info of urs

[22/09/23, 9:06:35 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: Hey everyone! Hope everyone doing well....Okay...Let's challenge our minds with an intriguing aptitude question tonight ‎<This message was edited>
[22/09/23, 9:07:16 PM] ~ Sridhishnee: In a sequence, the first three terms form an arithmetic progression, and the next three terms form a geometric progression. If the first term of the arithmetic progression is 10, the common difference is 4, and the common ratio of the geometric progression is 2, what is the sixth term of the sequence?
[22/09/23, 9:10:47 PM] ~ Shankar Sai: As its our last day to be Community manager, We like to maxout the interactions... so planned apt and coding rounds

[22/09/23, 9:21:52 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Try carefully...there's a mistake...👀
Great efforts..✨
[22/09/23, 9:24:09 PM] ~ Pranesh: Arithmetic Progression:
First term = 10
Common difference = 4
a1 = 10
So 10,14,18
Geometric progression:starts from 18
First term G1= 18
Common ratio = 2
So
G1*2=36,
G1*4=72,
G1*8=144,
Series is :
10,14,18,36,72,144
So, the sixth term of the sequence is 144.
[22/09/23, 9:25:11 PM] ~ Dharshuu: Yeah!!it's correct!!..
[22/09/23, 9:25:31 PM] ~ 👩🏻‍🎓Sree👩🏻‍🎓: Arithmetic Progression:
First term = 10
Common difference = 4
a1 = 10
a2 = a1 + d = 10 + 4 = 14
a3 = a2 + d = 14 + 4 = 18
Geometric progression:
First term = 18
Common ratio = 2
a4= a3 * r = 18 * 2 = 36
a5 = a4* r = 36 * 2 = 72
a6 = a5* r = 72 * 2 = 144
So, the sixth term of the sequence is 144.

[24/09/23, 9:47:58 PM] ~ 🤹‍♂️꧁P҉r҉a҉n҉a҉v҉꧁vikraman꧂🤿: Now, when I send you this information, I'm sure it will definitely catch your attention. 😄📚

You see, sometimes the paragraphs I send don't quite land well, and I get it - they can be a bit of a read. But guess what? I've got a fresh batch for you, and I hope you're ready to dive in! 📖🚀

I genuinely believe you'll enjoy going through it all this time. So, go on, read it all. And hey, thanks a million for taking the time to read through these messages! 🙏📖

Now, let's have some fun, folks! 🎉😄


Hello everyone! 🌟

I'm back with some exciting information that I truly believe can make your day brighter. I'd like to share this based on my own experiences, not just as your friend and classmate, but also as someone who genuinely cares about your future. 📚🤝

First things first, I've noticed that some of you are not on LinkedIn, and I must admit, I'm a bit puzzled as to why. Let's explore just how vital LinkedIn is in today's world. 🌐🤔

LinkedIn is a super helpful application, especially when it comes to job opportunities and internships. The best part? It's incredibly user-friendly, and its features are mind-blowing! 🚀📱

Now, if you think it's too late to start because you're in your second year, think again. It's never too late, but do tread carefully. 🚦

Here's where it gets interesting. I'm here to guide you on how to get started and grow your LinkedIn community. So, give it a read, and you'll surely get some ideas. 💡📈

A vital tip: When you're posting anything, remember, keywords are crucial, and so is knowing your target audience. So, take a moment to craft your posts thoughtfully. ⌨️🎯

Timing is everything. Posting late at night or too early in the morning might not be the best strategy. Aim for that sweet spot between 4 pm to 7 pm. You can even schedule your posts during your free time, and they'll automatically go out at the right time. 🕓📆

I won't insist on this, but I genuinely believe it's worth seeing my posts and captions. Sometimes, a small gesture like giving them a like can help my posts reach more people. 📸👍

Oh, and here's a little trick: Post your photo at the beginning of your post. LinkedIn can recognize that it's really you, and it'll help you reach more connections. 📸👥

Lastly, before you dive into posting your content, try following more people. It's a great way to start building your network. 🤝

I hope these tips encourage you to take LinkedIn seriously. Your future career could be just a connection away! 💼🚀

Best wishes,
PRANAV VIKRAMAN S.S 👋🌟

I would explore different options to integrate the elephant into my life responsibly. One possibility could be to seek partnerships or collaborations with local zoo

Lastly, I would use this experience as an opportunity to learn about wildlife care, conservation, and animal behavior

Overall, Receiving an elephant is unexpected and challenging, I would focus on ensuring the elephant's welfare

[25/09/23, 9:52:43 PM] ~ Justin: First of all Thanks for the Elephant @917603957248 🫡🙏 I think have been burdened with glorious purpose, so I need to generate a ton. of money with it 🤑


heres my plan 

Business Name: That Elephant Man

Business Idea: take the elephant and sell the time its spends on an event for some money, and digital market it. put social media ads, and more advertising 

Business Idea: Renting the elephant for events and generating revenue by the event time spent. paid in hours

Business Marketing Plan: Put ads in social media, word of mouth sales, do reels with the elephant for viral marketing. 

One Liner: "Rent our elephant, make your event elegant"

Idha panniyum no one is renting my elephant na, Ill go to places where foreigners live and ill tie my elephant and put a fruit stall nearby, and market those as special fruits for DOLLARS 💸💸💰


Idhuvum fail aachu na, do reels with it in the back, thats it.

So I basically use my gift to buy more gifts to myself.

Anyways thanks for the elephant, I have named it Mani (Money)

[26/09/23, 8:34:55 PM] ~ 🤹‍♂️꧁P҉r҉a҉n҉a҉v҉꧁vikraman꧂🤿: *Question:* 

Sixty-four players seeded from seed 1 to seed 64 participated in a knock-out tennis
tournament. Seed 1 is the highest seed and seed 64 is the lowest seed. The tournament would be played in six rounds i.e., first round, second round, third round, quarterfinals, semi finals and final. In the first round, the player with the highest seed (i.e., 1) would play with the player with the lowest seed (i.e., 64) which is designated Match No.1.
Similarly, the player with the second highest seed (i.e., 2) would play with the player with the second lowest seed (i.e., 63), which is designated Match No.2 and so on. In the second round, the winner of the Match No.1 of the first round would play with the winner of the Match No.32 of the first round and this match is designated Match No.1 of the second round.
Similarly, the winner of the Match No.2 of the first round would play with the winner of the Match No.31 of the first round and this match is designated Match No.2 of the second round and so on. In the similar pattern the subsequent rounds will be played.
If the player seeded 43 won the tournament, then which of the following players cannot be the runner-up?

*Options are:*👇🏻

1. Player seeded 44
2.Player seeded 45

Right now, IoT alone won't cut it. We need to diversify into various domains. So, as we move forward, we must develop new technologies and embrace future innovations. My suggestion: think smarter and wiser. By the way, your idea and thoughts 💭 are fantastic!

[30/09/23, 5:22:34 PM] ~ 🤹‍♂️꧁P҉r҉a҉n҉a҉v҉꧁vikraman꧂🤿: Hey everyone! 🌟 I've got something important to share with you today – the power of GitHub! 💼

Imagine GitHub as your personal showcase for all your amazing projects. 🚀 It's not just for coders; designers and ECE students like us can benefit too! Let me explain with a real-life example:

Picture this: a regular guy uploads his project on GitHub, keeping the code secret. Later, Microsoft offers him a job! 🤯 How cool is that? Uploading your projects on GitHub is like making yourself known to the world as a talented creator.

Now, as ECE students, we can join in too. Have you heard of domains like "Verilog"? Yep, they involve coding too! So, don't hesitate to upload your ECE projects.

Here's the trick: Make sure your projects are public, so others can see your incredible work. Worried about security? No need! GitHub is open-source, but folks can't copy your code. Plus, during interviews, your projects will shine!

In summary, GitHub is a goldmine for opportunities. It's not just about what you've done; it's about showing it to the world. Get ready to impress! 💪

Feel free to share this with your friends, and let's unlock those GitHub benefits together! 🌐🚀


Now, let's take a closer look at the step-by-step process of how to upload your project.


1. Create a GitHub Account: 🚀 If you don't have one, start by signing up for a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).

2. Login to GitHub: 🔑 Log in to your GitHub account.

3. Create a New Repository: 📂 Click on the '+' icon in the upper right corner and choose 'New repository'. Fill in the repository name, description, and other details.

4. Initialize with README: 📝 You can choose to initialize the repository with a README file.

5. Add Your Project File: 📁 Add your project files to a folder on your computer.

6. Open Git Bash: 🐚 If you're using Git Bash, navigate to your project folder by using the 'cd' command. 

7. Initialize Git: 🔄 Type `git init` to initialize a Git repository in your project folder.

8. Add Your Files to Git: 📤 Use `git add .` to add all your project files to the staging area. Or replace the `.` with specific file names to add them individually.

9. Commit Your Changes: 💾 Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.

10. Link to GitHub: 🌐 Create a connection to your GitHub repository using `git remote add origin <repository URL>`. Replace `<repository URL>` with your GitHub repository's URL.

11. Push Your Code : 🚀 Push your code to GitHub with `git push -u origin master`.

12. Authentication: 🔐 GitHub will prompt you for your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

13. Check GitHub: 🖥️ Visit your GitHub repository page to see your project's files.

14. Celebrate!: 🎉 You've successfully uploaded your project to GitHub. Share your repository link with others.

Remember to replace `<repository URL>` and `<username>` with your actual repository URL and username. Happy coding!


*""Certainly! Here are some things an ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) student can code and their corresponding languages...!!!!""*

1. 📡 Digital Circuits: You can use VHDL or Verilog for coding digital circuits in FPGAs and CPLDs.

2. 🤖 Microcontrollers: For embedded systems, try coding in C or C++ for microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

3. 🌐 Web Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for building web applications and websites.

4. 📱 Mobile Apps: Java or Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS app development.

5. 🤯 Data Analysis: Python is perfect for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

6. 🌐 Networking: Learn Python or Java for network programming and simulation.

7. 📊 Signal Processing: MATLAB is your friend for signal processing and simulations.

8. 🌐 Internet of Things (IoT): Use languages like Python or C/C++ to code IoT devices.

9. 🎮 Game Development: Try Unity with C# for game development.

10. 🤖 Robotics: Python, C++, or ROS (Robot Operating System) for programming robots.

Remember, as an ECE student, your coding choices depend on your interests and projects. So, explore and have fun coding! 😊👨‍💻

So..
[01/10/23, 12:31:38 PM] ThiyagaB: Dear Sapiens,

Its been 3+ months since we formed this community, and its time we get into action and do more,   I am now excited to introduce, 

**CodeSapiens - Do**

a new sub-group in this community.

This group will help students in their projects, hackathons or their self initiated ones or even if its an idea for a small startup.   

I will bring experts also to this group to guide you ppl and you also can discuss with other students to explore, reuse and bring your ideas to action quicker.

But unlike this group, this one is private, only interested/committed/selected students only can join.

The selection criteria for now will be a coding contest, and in future anyone who can showcase their ideas or their projects can join the group.  The details about the contest will be shared soon before 4pm today.  

So stay tuned.
